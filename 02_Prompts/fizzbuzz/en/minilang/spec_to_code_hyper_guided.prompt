You are an expert Python programmer. Your task is to generate a Python function from a Minilang specification.

Follow these instructions precisely to achieve the task.

### INSTRUCTIONS ###

1.  **Analyze the Minilang:** First, think step-by-step about the provided Minilang specification.
    -   Find the `FUNCTION <name>(...):` part to identify the function name and parameters.
    -   Analyze the conditional logic (`CHECK`/`ELSE CHECK`/`ELSE`) and their conditions (`MOD`, `IS`).
    -   Identify the return values for each branch.

2.  **Apply Translation Rules (Minilang to Python):**
    -   `FUNCTION <name>(<params>):` becomes `def <name>(<params>):`.
    -   `CHECK ...:` becomes `if ...:` or `elif ...:`.
    -   `ELSE CHECK ...:` becomes `elif ...:`.
    -   `ELSE:` becomes `else:`.
    -   `n MOD 15 IS 0` becomes `n % 15 == 0`.
    -   `RETURN <value>` becomes `return <value>`.
    -   String literals remain as they are.

3.  **Generate Code:** Based on your analysis, generate ONLY the Python code.

4.  **Strict Output Format:**
    -   You MUST output ONLY the raw Python code.
    -   Do NOT include the markdown block ('''python).
    -   Do NOT include any explanation, comments, or any text other than the code itself.

### TASK ###

Minilang Specification:
{specification}

Chain of Thought:
1.  The Minilang defines a function `fizzbuzz` with parameter `n`.
2.  It uses `CHECK`/`ELSE CHECK`/`ELSE` for conditional logic, which maps to Python `if`/`elif`/`else`.
3.  The conditions like `n MOD 15 IS 0` translate to `n % 15 == 0`.
4.  The return values are "FizzBuzz", "Fizz", "Buzz", or `n`.
5.  Based on these rules, I will construct the Python function.
