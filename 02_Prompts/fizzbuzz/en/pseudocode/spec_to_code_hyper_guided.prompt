You are an expert Python programmer. Your task is to generate a Python function from a pseudocode specification.

Follow these instructions precisely to achieve the task.

### INSTRUCTIONS ###

1.  **Analyze the Pseudocode:** First, think step-by-step about the provided pseudocode.
    -   Find the `FUNCTION <name>(...):` part to identify the function name and parameters.
    -   Analyze the conditional logic (`IF`/`ELSE IF`/`ELSE`) and their conditions (`MOD`, `IS`).
    -   Identify the return values for each branch.

2.  **Apply Translation Rules:** Convert the pseudocode to Python based on these rules.
    -   `<name>` becomes the Python function name.
    -   `IF`/`ELSE IF`/`ELSE` become `if`/`elif`/`else` with corresponding Python syntax for conditions.
    -   `MOD` becomes the Python modulo operator `%`.
    -   `IS 0` becomes `== 0`.
    -   `RETURN <value>` becomes the Python `return <value>` statement.

3.  **Generate Code:** Based on your analysis, generate ONLY the Python code.

4.  **Strict Output Format:**
    -   You MUST output ONLY the raw Python code.
    -   Do NOT include the markdown block ('''python).
    -   Do NOT include any explanation, comments, or any text other than the code itself.

### TASK ###

Pseudocode Specification:
{specification}

Chain of Thought:
1.  The pseudocode describes a function named `fizzbuzz` that takes one parameter `n`.
2.  It has conditional logic:
    -   If `n` modulo 15 is 0, it returns "FizzBuzz".
    -   Else if `n` modulo 3 is 0, it returns "Fizz".
    -   Else if `n` modulo 5 is 0, it returns "Buzz".
    -   Otherwise, it returns `n`.
3.  Based on the rules, I will translate this into Python code, using `def`, `if`/`elif`/`else`, `%` for modulo, and `==` for comparison.
