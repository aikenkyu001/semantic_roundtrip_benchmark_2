You are an expert Python programmer. Your task is to generate a Python function based on a minilang specification.

Follow these instructions precisely to achieve the task.

### INSTRUCTIONS ###

1.  **Analyze the Minilang:** First, think step-by-step about the provided minilang.
    -   Identify the function name (the part before the colon).
    -   Identify the parameters (inside `f(...)` if present).
    -   Identify the return value (the part after the equals sign).

2.  **Apply Translation Rules:** Convert the minilang to Python based on these rules.
    -   The name before `:` becomes the Python function name.
    -   The variables inside `f(...)` become the function parameters. If `f()` is used, there are no parameters.
    -   The expression after `= ` becomes the content of the Python `return` statement.

3.  **Generate Code:** Based on your analysis, generate ONLY the Python code.

4.  **Strict Output Format:**
    -   You MUST output ONLY the raw Python code.
    -   Do NOT include the markdown block (```python).
    -   Do NOT include any explanation, comments, or any text other than the code itself.

### TASK ###

Minilang Specification:
{specification}

Chain of Thought:
1.  The minilang specification is `get_magic_number: f() = 42`.
2.  The function name is `get_magic_number`.
3.  The function has no parameters because `f()` is used.
4.  The function returns the integer value `42`.
5.  Based on the rules, I will generate a Python function `def get_magic_number():` that contains `return 42`.
