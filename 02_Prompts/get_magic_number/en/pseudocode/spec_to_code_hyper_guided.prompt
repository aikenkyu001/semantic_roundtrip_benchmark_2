You are an expert Python programmer. Your task is to generate a Python function from a pseudocode specification.

Follow these instructions precisely to achieve the task.

### INSTRUCTIONS ###

1.  **Analyze the Pseudocode:** First, think step-by-step about the provided pseudocode.
    -   Find the `FUNCTION <name>(...):` part to identify the function name.
    -   Find the `RETURN <value>` part to identify the return value.

2.  **Apply Translation Rules:** Convert the pseudocode to Python based on these rules.
    -   `<name>` becomes the Python function name.
    -   `RETURN <value>` becomes the content of the Python `return` statement.

3.  **Generate Code:** Based on your analysis, generate ONLY the Python code.

4.  **Strict Output Format:**
    -   You MUST output ONLY the raw Python code.
    -   Do NOT include the markdown block (```python).
    -   Do NOT include any explanation, comments, or any text other than the code itself.

### TASK ###

Pseudocode Specification:
{specification}

Chain of Thought:
1.  The pseudocode is `FUNCTION get_magic_number(): RETURN 42`.
2.  The function name is `get_magic_number`.
3.  The return value is `42`.
4.  Based on the rules, I will generate `def get_magic_number():` and `return 42`.
