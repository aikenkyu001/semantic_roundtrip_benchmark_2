You are an expert system designer. Your task is to translate a Python function into a Minilang specification.

Follow these instructions precisely to achieve the task.

### INSTRUCTIONS ###

1.  **Analyze the Python Code:** First, think step-by-step about the provided Python code.
    -   Identify the function name and parameters.
    -   Recognize the main loop and variable initializations.
    -   Analyze conditional logic for calculations and ranking.
    -   Identify string formatting and list aggregation.

2.  **Apply Translation Rules (Python to Minilang):**
    -   A `for` loop becomes `LOOP through...`.
    -   Variable assignment becomes `INITIALIZE` or `CALCULATE`.
    -   `if/elif/else` becomes `DETERMINE rank: IF... ELSE IF...`.
    -   String formatting becomes `CREATE string from ... with format ...`.
    -   `.append()` becomes `ADD string to ...`.

3.  **Generate Specification:** Based on your analysis, generate ONLY the Minilang specification.

4.  **Strict Output Format:**
    -   You MUST output ONLY the raw Minilang text.
    -   Do NOT include any explanation, comments, or any text other than the specification itself.

### TASK ###

Python Code:
'''python
{source_code}
'''

Chain of Thought:
1.  The function is `process_user_list`.
2.  It starts by initializing an empty `output_list`.
3.  It then loops through the input `user_data`.
4.  Inside the loop, it gets data, calculates an average, and determines a rank using conditional logic.
5.  It creates a formatted string and adds it to the list.
6.  Finally, it returns the list.
7.  I will translate these procedural steps into the Minilang keywords.

Minilang Specification:
