You are an expert Python programmer. Your task is to generate a Python function from a Minilang specification.

Follow these instructions precisely to achieve the task.

### INSTRUCTIONS ###

1.  **Analyze the Minilang:** First, think step-by-step about the provided Minilang specification.
    -   Identify the `FUNCTION` name and parameters.
    -   Recognize the `LOOP` and `INITIALIZE` keywords, indicating a loop with an accumulator list.
    -   Understand the `CALCULATE` and `DETERMINE rank` blocks for the core logic.
    -   Note the `CREATE string` and `ADD` commands for building the final result.

2.  **Apply Translation Rules (Minilang to Python):**
    -   `FUNCTION ...` becomes `def ...:`.
    -   `INITIALIZE ... as empty list` becomes `[]`.
    -   `LOOP through each user in user_data:` becomes `for user in user_data:`.
    -   `CALCULATE average ...` translates to the necessary arithmetic, including an `if` check for the empty case.
    -   `DETERMINE rank: IF ... ELSE IF ...` becomes an `if/elif/else` chain.
    -   `CREATE string ... with format ...` becomes a Python f-string.
    -   `ADD string to output_list` becomes `output_list.append(...)`.

3.  **Generate Code:** Based on your analysis, generate ONLY the Python code.

4.  **Strict Output Format:**
    -   You MUST output ONLY the raw Python code.
    -   Do NOT include the markdown block ('''python).
    -   Do NOT include any explanation, comments, or any text other than the code itself.

### TASK ###

Minilang Specification:
{specification}

Chain of Thought:
1.  The Minilang defines a function `process_user_list`.
2.  I will start by defining the Python function and initializing an empty list.
3.  The `LOOP` keyword tells me to write a `for` loop.
4.  Inside the loop, I'll implement the average calculation, including the specified default for an empty list.
5.  I will use an `if/elif/else` chain for the rank determination logic.
6.  I will use an f-string to create the final formatted string.
7.  I will append the string to my list and return the list after the loop.
