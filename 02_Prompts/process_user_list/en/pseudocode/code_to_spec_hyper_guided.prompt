You are an expert system designer. Your task is to translate a Python function into a pseudocode specification.

Follow these instructions precisely to achieve the task.

### INSTRUCTIONS ###

1.  **Analyze the Python Code:** First, think step-by-step about the provided Python code.
    -   Identify the function name and its parameters.
    -   Analyze the main loop structure.
    -   Identify data extraction from objects (e.g., getting values from a dictionary).
    -   Analyze conditional logic for calculations (e.g., handling empty lists).
    -   Analyze conditional logic for ranking.
    -   Identify how the final output string is formatted and aggregated.

2.  **Apply Translation Rules:** Convert Python constructs to pseudocode.
    -   `for user in user_data:` becomes `FOR EACH user in user_data:`.
    -   `sum(scores) / len(scores)` becomes `sum of scores / count of scores`.
    -   `if/elif/else` becomes `IF/ELSE IF/ELSE`.
    -   `f-string` formatting becomes `FORMAT ... as "..."`.
    -   `.append()` becomes `APPEND ... to ...`.

3.  **Generate Specification:** Based on your analysis, generate ONLY the pseudocode.

4.  **Strict Output Format:**
    -   You MUST output ONLY the raw pseudocode text.
    -   Do NOT include any explanation, comments, or any text other than the specification itself.

### TASK ###

Python Code:
'''python
{source_code}
'''

Chain of Thought:
1.  The function is `process_user_list` and takes `user_data`.
2.  It initializes an empty list `output_list`.
3.  It loops through each `user` in `user_data`.
4.  Inside the loop, it gets `scores` and `name`.
5.  It calculates `avg_score`, handling the case where `scores` is empty.
6.  It uses `if/elif/else` to determine a `rank` based on `avg_score`.
7.  It formats a string with the user's name, average score, and rank.
8.  It appends this string to `output_list`.
9.  Finally, it returns `output_list`.
10. I will translate these steps into the pseudocode format.

Pseudocode Specification:
