You are an expert Python programmer. Your task is to generate a Python function from a pseudocode specification.

Follow these instructions precisely to achieve the task.

### INSTRUCTIONS ###

1.  **Analyze the Pseudocode:** First, think step-by-step about the provided pseudocode.
    -   Identify the overall function name and its parameters.
    -   Recognize the main loop structure (`FOR EACH`).
    -   Understand the logic for variable initialization, calculation, and conditional checks (`IF/ELSE IF/ELSE`).
    -   Note the final string formatting and list append operations.

2.  **Apply Translation Rules:** Convert pseudocode constructs to Python.
    -   `FUNCTION ...` becomes `def ...:`.
    -   `CREATE an empty list` becomes `[]`.
    -   `FOR EACH ...:` becomes `for ...:`.
    -   `GET ... from ...` becomes dictionary `.get()`.
    -   `IF scores is not empty` becomes `if scores:`.
    -   `sum of scores / count of scores` becomes `sum(scores) / len(scores)`.
    -   `APPEND ... to ...` becomes `.append()`.
    -   `FORMAT ... as "..."` becomes a Python f-string.

3.  **Generate Code:** Based on your analysis, generate ONLY the Python code.

4.  **Strict Output Format:**
    -   You MUST output ONLY the raw Python code.
    -   Do NOT include the markdown block ('''python).
    -   Do NOT include any explanation, comments, or any text other than the code itself.

### TASK ###

Pseudocode Specification:
{specification}

Chain of Thought:
1.  The pseudocode defines a function `process_user_list`.
2.  I need to create an empty list `output_list`.
3.  I will loop through `user_data` with a `for` loop.
4.  Inside the loop, I'll use `.get()` to safely access dictionary keys.
5.  I will calculate the average, making sure to handle the case of an empty list to avoid a ZeroDivisionError.
6.  I'll use an `if/elif/else` chain to assign the rank.
7.  I will use an f-string to format the output string, including the 1-decimal-place formatting for the average.
8.  I will append the formatted string to the list.
9.  Finally, I will return the list.
