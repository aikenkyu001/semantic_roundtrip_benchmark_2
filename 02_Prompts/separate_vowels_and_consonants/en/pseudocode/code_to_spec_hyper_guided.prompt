You are an expert system designer. Your task is to translate a Python function into a pseudocode specification.

To achieve this task, follow these instructions precisely.

### Instructions ###

1.  **Analyze the Python Code:** First, consider the provided Python code step-by-step.
    -   Identify the function name and its arguments.
    -   Analyze the main loop structure.
    -   Identify the process of separating characters based on vowel status.
    -   Identify the final concatenation step.

2.  **Apply Translation Rules:** Convert Python syntax to pseudocode.
    -   `for char in input_string:` becomes `for each character in input_string:`
    -   `if char in vowels:` becomes `if character is in vowels:`
    -   `.append()` becomes `add character to ...`
    -   `"".join(...)` becomes `concatenated string of ...`

3.  **Generate the Specification:** Based on your analysis, generate only the pseudocode.

4.  **Strict Output Format:**
    -   **ALWAYS** output only the pseudocode text.
    -   Do not include explanations, comments, or any other text outside the specification.

### Task ###

Python Code:
'''python
{source_code}
'''

Thinking Process:
1.  The function is `separate_vowels_and_consonants` and takes `input_string` as an argument.
2.  Initialize `vowel_chars` and `consonant_chars` as empty lists.
3.  Define the `vowels` string.
4.  Loop through each character in `input_string`.
5.  Inside the loop, check if the character is a vowel.
6.  Append to the respective list.
7.  Concatenate and return the results.
8.  Translate these steps into pseudocode.

Pseudocode Specification:
