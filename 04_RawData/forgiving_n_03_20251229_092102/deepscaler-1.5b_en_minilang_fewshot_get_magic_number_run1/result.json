Let's start by understanding what each part of the Python code does.\n\nThe first line is `def get_magic_number():`, which defines a function named get_magic_number that takes no parameters and returns 42. In minilang terms, functions are represented with their names in square brackets, like [function_name]. So this would translate to [[get_magic_number]].\n\nNext, I look at the return statement: `return 42`. In minilang, numbers are usually written without quotes if they're constants or variables. Since it's a constant here, I can represent it as just '42'. However, in the example provided, the specification uses an equation format where the right-hand side is defined using f(a, b) = ... So perhaps we should structure this accordingly.\n\nPutting it all together, the function returns 42. In minilang, each line starts with [function_name]. For the return statement, since there's no parameter and the result is a constant, I can represent it as [[get_magic_number]].return('42') or perhaps more accurately, using an equation notation.\n\nWait, looking back at the example, in the first case, the function definition uses add: f(a,b) = a + b. So for this problem, since it's only returning 42 without any parameters or complex logic, maybe the specification should just list the function name followed by its result as an equation.\n\nSo perhaps the correct translation is [[get_magic_number]]: returns '42'. But more accurately, in minilang, functions are defined using their names in brackets and then describe what they return. Since there's no parameter or complex logic beyond returning 42, maybe it's better to represent it as a single line with the function name followed by its result.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the specification would be [[get_magic_number]]: returns '42'. Alternatively, considering that in minilang, each line represents an expression or definition. So perhaps it's more accurate to write it as [[get_magic_number]]: f(a) = 42. But since there are no parameters, maybe just [function_name] and the result.\n\nWait, looking again at the example provided by the user:\n\nExample:\nPython Code:\ndef add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\nMinilang Specification:\nadd: f(a, b) = a + b\n\nSo in this case, the function is defined as taking two parameters, returning their sum. The minilang specification shows the function name followed by its parameters and an equation.\n\nIn our task, the Python code is only defining get_magic_number to return 42 without any parameters or operations beyond that. So perhaps the minilang specification should simply list [[get_magic_number]] with its result as a constant.\n\nTherefore, the correct translation would be:\n\n[[get_magic_number]]: returns '42'\n\nBut since in minilang, each line represents an expression or definition. Since it's just one line, maybe we can represent it as:\n\n[[get_magic_number]] = 42\n\nAlternatively, considering that functions are defined with their names in brackets and then a description of what they return.\n\nSo perhaps the correct specification is:\n\n[[get_magic_number]]: returns '42'\n\nBut I think more accurately, since there's no parameter or operation beyond returning 42, it would be represented as [[get_magic_number]] = 42. Alternatively, considering that in minilang, functions are defined with their names and then the return value.\n\nSo perhaps the correct way is:\n\n[[get_magic_number]]: returns '42'\n\nBut to fit the structure of the example, maybe it's better to write it as [[get_magic_number]] equals 42. Or perhaps just list the function name followed by its result as an equation.\n\nIn any case, the key points are that it's a function named get_magic_number returning 42.\n</think>\n\n[[get_magic_number]]: returns '42'",
