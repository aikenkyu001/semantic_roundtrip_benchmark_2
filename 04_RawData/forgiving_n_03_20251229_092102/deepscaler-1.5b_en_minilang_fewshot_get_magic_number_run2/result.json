Let me look at the example first to understand how it's done.\n\nIn Example 1, the Python code defines a function called add that takes two arguments a and b and returns their sum. The minilang specification translates this by writing \"add: f(a, b) = a + b\". So, the key steps are identifying the function name, its parameters, and the return value.\n\nNow, looking at the task code provided:\n\ndef get_magic_number():\n    return 42\n\nThis is a simple function called get_magic_number that returns 42. There's no parameter here since it doesn't take any inputs; every time it's called, it just returns 42.\n\nSo, to translate this into minilang, I should create an entry where the key is 'get_magic_number', and the value represents what it does. Since there are no parameters, the function has zero arguments. Therefore, in minilang terms, the specification would be something like \"get_magic_number: f = 42\".\n\nWait, but looking back at the task example, the return is written as a mathematical expression or a formula. In this case, it's just returning a constant value, so perhaps it's better to represent it as \"f = 42\" without any parameters.\n\nAlternatively, since there are no variables involved in the function's output, maybe it's more accurate to say that the function returns a fixed number. So the minilang specification would be:\n\nget_magic_number: f = 42\n\nThis seems appropriate because the function doesn't depend on any inputs and always outputs 42.\n</think>\n\nget_magic_number: f = 42",
