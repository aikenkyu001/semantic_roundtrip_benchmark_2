Let me first look at the example provided to understand how it's done.\n\nIn Example 1, the Python code defines a function called add that takes two parameters a and b and returns their sum. The minilang specification translates this by defining a function named 'add' with parameters f(a, b) = a + b.\n\nNow, looking at the task provided, the Python code is:\n\ndef get_magic_number():\n    return 42\n\nI need to convert this into a minilang specification. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that there's no function name given; perhaps it should be named explicitly in minilang. The function here takes an empty parameter list because the parameters are not provided. In Python, functions without parameters start with def and then just return. So in minilang, this would translate to a new function called 'magic_number' which returns 42.\n\nSo the structure should be: magic_number() = 42\n\nI should make sure that there's only one line of code, as per the example. Therefore, the minilang specification will have just one line defining the function and its return value.\n</think>\n\nminilang_specification:\nmagic_number: () = 42",
