The Python function is called get_sum and returns the sum of a and b. In pseudocode, this should be similar but maybe more verbosely described.\n\nNow, the task is to take the second Python code snippet: def get_magic_number(): return 42. I need to convert this into pseudocode without any explanation.\n\nFirst, I'll start by writing the function definition in pseudocode. In standard pseudocode, functions are written with a function name, parameters separated by commas, and then the body comes next. So for get_magic_number, it would be something like:\n\nFunction get_magic_number()\n    returns 42\n\nBut wait, looking at the example, they used \"FUNCTION\" keyword in their pseudocode. But maybe I should just stick to more common pseudocode structures without using keywords like 'function'. Alternatively, perhaps using a block structure is better.\n\nSo another way could be:\n\nFunction get_magic_number()\n    return 42\n\nBut sometimes people prefer explicit types or process steps. However, since the task is just to translate into pseudocode and not necessarily make it more verbose, maybe the first approach is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each statement should have its own line for clarity. But in pseudocode, often statements are written on separate lines without specific indentation unless required by the language.\n\nSo putting it all together, the pseudocode would be:\n\nFunction get_magic_number()\n    return 42\n\nI think that's clear enough and matches the functionality of the original Python code.\n</think>\n\nFUNCTION get_magic_number()\n    RETURN 42",
