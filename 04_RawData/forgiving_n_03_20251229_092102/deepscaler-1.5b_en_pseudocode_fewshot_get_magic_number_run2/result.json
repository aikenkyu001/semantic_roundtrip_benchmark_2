The example had a function called get_sum that takes two arguments and returns their sum. The pseudocode was straightforward with just the function definition and the return statement.\n\nNow, looking at the task's Python code: it defines a function called get_magic_number which simply returns 42. So I need to create a similar structure in pseudocode.\n\nFirst, the function name should be written as function get_magic_number(). Then, inside this function, since there are no arguments except maybe implicitly, but in this case, perhaps it's just returning without any parameters. Wait, actually, looking at the example, they didn't pass any arguments to the function. So perhaps in our case, the function has no parameters and returns 42 directly.\n\nSo putting that together: the pseudocode should be a function named get_magic_number that returns 42.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include any explanations, just the specification. Also, since the example had only one line for the return statement, perhaps in this case, it's also a single-line return.\n\nSo putting it all together: function definition with no parameters, and return 42.\n</think>\n\nfunction get_magic_number()\n    return 42",
