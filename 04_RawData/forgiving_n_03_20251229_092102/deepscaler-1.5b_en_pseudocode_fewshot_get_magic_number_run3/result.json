The example provided shows that for functions in Python, we replace them with function names and use keywords like \"return\" or \"LET\". \n\nLooking at the first task's Python code: def get_magic_number(): return 42. So this is a function that returns 42 when called.\n\nTo translate into pseudocode, I should write a function named get_magic_number which takes no parameters but according to the example, maybe it's just returning a constant regardless of input. Wait, in Python, functions can have any arguments, including none. But since there are no arguments here, perhaps we don't need to handle that.\n\nSo for pseudocode, I should write something like:\n\nDefine function get_magic_number() which returns 42.\n\nI think the simplest way is just to return 42 regardless of any input parameters because in this case, it's a constant. So the pseudocode would be straightforward.\n</think>\n\nFUNCTION get_magic_number()\n    RETURN 42",
