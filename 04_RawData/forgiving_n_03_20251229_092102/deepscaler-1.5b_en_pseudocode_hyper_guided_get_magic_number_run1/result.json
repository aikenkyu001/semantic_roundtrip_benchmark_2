Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the provided Python code: it's a function called get_magic_number() which returns 42. So my task is to take that and convert it into pseudocode as per the rules given.\n\nThe first instruction says to analyze the Python code and identify the function name from the def statement. In this case, the function is named get_magic_number(). That seems straightforward.\n\nNext, I need to find the return value of the function because in pseudocode, the return statement is used instead of return in Python. So the function returns 42, so that's the value we'll translate into a RETURN instruction in pseudocode.\n\nThe instructions also mention applying translation rules: the function name becomes FUNCTION <name>() and the return value becomes RETURN <value>. So putting this together, I should create two lines for these parts.\n\nI need to make sure that the output is only the specification without any extra text. Therefore, the final output will consist of just the pseudocode representation of the function, which includes both the name and the return statement.\n</think>\n\n```\nFUNCTION get_magic_number():\n    RETURN 42\n```",
