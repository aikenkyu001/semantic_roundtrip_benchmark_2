Let's look at the example first to understand the structure.\n\nIn Example 1, the function definition is translated into a series of function calls and parameters using parentheses and commas. Each parameter is enclosed in parentheses with their values inside, separated by commas if there are multiple. The return value is also shown as a tuple wrapped in parentheses.\n\nNow, looking at the task input: \n\ndef get_magic_number():\n    return 42\n\nThis is a simple function that returns 42 when called without any arguments because it's defined with no parameters. So, I need to represent this in S-expression format.\n\nFirst, since there are no parameters for get_magic_number(), each parameter part will be empty tuples or something indicating no arguments. But wait, actually, the function has zero parameters. In S-expressions, functions can have optional parameters, but here it's probably treated as having none.\n\nThe return value is 42, which in S-expression terms would be a number. So, the structure would start with the function name get_magic_number followed by any parameters (none here), and then the result 42 wrapped appropriately.\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, since there are no parameters, each parameter part should have an empty tuple or just nothing inside. But how does that translate into S-expressions?\n\nLooking at Example 1's structure: it starts with a function call in parentheses, then parameters in separate parentheses, and returns as another tuple with the value.\n\nSo for get_magic_number(), which has no arguments, perhaps we represent it as (get_magic_number ()), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe each parameter is represented as an empty list or something similar.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach: since there are no parameters, the function would have zero parameters. So in S-expression terms, this would be written as (get_magic_number), followed by its return value 42 wrapped as a tuple with nothing else because it's a single return value.\n\nSo putting it all together, the S-expression specification would start with (function name get_magic_number) and then since there are no parameters, perhaps just leave it as (get_magic_number). Then the returns part is ((value 42)) but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe it's represented as (function (parameters) returns).\n\nWait, perhaps a more precise way: for each function definition, we have:\n\n(function name parameters) returns (value expression)\n\nBut since there are no parameters and the return is 42, perhaps it's written as (get_magic_number () () ... ) but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe just write it as (get_magic_number), with an empty tuple for parameters, followed by ((value 42)).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each parameter part is represented as a list of tuples, like (a, b) where each element is something.\n\nBut perhaps the correct approach is to represent the function call as:\n\n(get_magic_number ())\n\nAnd then the return value is just 42, so the complete S-expression would be ((function (get_magic_number ()) returns (value 42)))\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think step by step. For a function like get_sum(a, b), which takes two parameters and returns their sum, the structure is:\n\n(function name parameters) returns (value expression)\n\nEach parameter part is written as (param_name value). So for get_sum, the parameters would be ((a), (b)), but perhaps more accurately represented as (a and b are both parameters).\n\nBut in this case, since there's no such function, it's just a single return.\n\nSo for get_magic_number(), which has zero parameters and returns 42:\n\nThe structure is: (get_magic_number) followed by its return value. Since the return is just an integer, perhaps written as ((value 42)).\n\nPutting it all together, the S-expression would be:\n\n(get_magic_number)\n\nBut since it's a function without arguments, maybe we need to represent each parameter as an empty list or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write it as:\n\n(get_magic_number ())\n\nThen the return value is 42, so ((value 42)).\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately: The entire expression would start with (get_magic_number), followed by its parameters (none), and then the return part which is ((value 42)). So putting them together as:\n\n(get_magic_number) returns (value 42)\n\nBut in S-expression terms, it's written as a function call followed by its return value.\n\nSo perhaps the correct structure is:\n\nFunction name get_magic_number with no parameters: so it would be written as (get_magic_number). Then the return is ((value 42)).\n\nTherefore, combining these parts, the S-expression specification would start with (get_magic_number), then since there are no parameters, but we need to show that each parameter has their value. Since there are none, perhaps just leave it as an empty tuple or similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each parameter is represented as a list of tuples, like ((a), (b)), where a and b are the arguments passed when calling the function. But since this function doesn't take any parameters, perhaps we can represent it as no parameters.\n\nI think the correct way is to write:\n\n(get_magic_number) returns (value 42)\n\nBut in S-expression terms, each return value is wrapped in parentheses with a single value inside if it's an expression that evaluates to one. Since this function just returns 42 directly, perhaps we can represent it as ((value 42)).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n(get_magic_number) returns (value 42)\n\nBut perhaps more accurately, the S-expression would be structured as a function call with parameters followed by its return value. So for no parameters, each parameter part is empty or represented differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to represent the function as ((get_magic_number) ()), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that since there are no parameters, each parameter in S-expression would be an empty tuple. So for get_magic_number(), which has zero arguments:\n\nThe structure would be (get_magic_number). Then, since it returns 42 directly, the return part is ((value 42)).\n\nSo combining them: (get_magic_number) returns ((value 42))\n\nTherefore, the final S-expression specification is:\n\n(get_magic_number) returns ((value 42))\n</think>\n\n(get_magic_number) returns ((value 42)))",
