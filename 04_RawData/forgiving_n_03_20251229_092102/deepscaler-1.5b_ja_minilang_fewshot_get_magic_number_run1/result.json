The example shows that the Python function add takes two parameters and returns their sum. The output is written as add: f(a, b) = a + b.\n\nSo, for the new code, which is def get_magic_number(): return 42, I need to translate it into this format. \n\nFirst, identify the function name. The function is called get_magic_number, so that becomes 'get_magic_number'. Then, since there's only one parameter, maybe not using a colon? Or perhaps it should still follow the pattern of having parameters inside parentheses.\n\nWait, in the example, the function definition was written as def add(a, b): which returns something. In the mini language, I think we can structure it similarly but without the 'def' part because it's just a function name and its description.\n\nSo for get_magic_number(), it would be described as f(x) = 42. That makes sense because it takes one argument x and returns 42.\n\nI should check if there are any special cases or if I need to add more details, but since the example only involves returning a constant, maybe that's sufficient.\n\nSo putting it all together, the mini language would be: get_magic_number: f(x) = 42.
