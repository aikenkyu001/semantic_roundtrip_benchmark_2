The example given shows that the Python code defines a function called add with parameters a and b, returning their sum. The MPS converts this to something like \"add: f(a, b) = a + b\".\n\nSo, for the task, the user has provided another Python code snippet:\n\ndef get_magic_number():\n    return 42\n\nI need to convert this into an equivalent MPS format. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, identify the function name and parameters. The function is named get_magic_number with no arguments. In MPS, I should probably just write \"get_magic_number\" as the key.\n\nNext, since there are no return values (the number 42), but in some cases, functions might have return values. However, in this case, it's returning a constant, not an expression. So maybe I can represent it similarly to how add was handled, using f() notation with parameters.\n\nWait, looking at the example, when there are no variables like 'a' and 'b', perhaps we don't include them. But since get_magic_number doesn't take any arguments, maybe we just have \"get_magic_number: =42\". Alternatively, if it's a function that returns 42, perhaps using f() notation.\n\nWait, in the example given by the user, when they converted the add function, they used variables like a and b. For get_magic_number, there are no parameters, so maybe we just write \"get_magic_number: =42\".\n\nAlternatively, if it's intended to have a return value, perhaps using f() but without arguments. So maybe \"get_magic_number: f()=42\". But in the example, they used variables like a and b, which suggests that for functions with parameters, we include them.\n\nBut since get_magic_number has no parameters, perhaps it's better to just write \"get_magic_number: =42\".\n\nLet me think again. The user provided the code:\n\ndef get_magic_number():\n    return 42\n\nIn MPS, this would be something like \"get_magic_number: f()=42\", but since there are no variables a and b, maybe it's just written without parameters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps since there are no variables, we can represent it as \"get_magic_number: =42\".\n\nI think the correct approach is to write the function name followed by colon, then either 'f()' with parameters or 'return' if it has a return value. Since this function doesn't take any arguments and returns 42, perhaps it's better to just represent it as \"get_magic_number: =42\".\n\nSo putting it all together, the MPS would be:\n\nget_magic_number: f()=42\n\nWait, but in the example given by the user, they used variables like a and b.
