The Python code is:\n\ndef add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\nAnd the converted version is:\n\nadd: f(a, b) = a + b\n\nAlright, so it seems like the function definition in Python is being translated into something that defines a function with parameters and returns an expression.\n\nThe task is to take this code and convert it into a mini language specification. Let me look at the second example provided:\n\nPython code:\ndef get_magic_number():\n    return 42\n\nI need to write the corresponding mini version. The output should be like:\n\nget_magic_number: f() = 42\n\nSo, I need to parse the Python function definition and capture its parameters and return value.\n\nFirst, identify if there's a function or not. In this case, it's a function called get_magic_number that takes no arguments but returns 42.\n\nIn the mini version, it should be something like 'get_magic_number: f() = 42'.\n\nSo, I'll structure it similarly to the first example, replacing the function name and parameters accordingly.\n\nI think the key steps are:\n\n1. Identify if there's a function (def) or just a value.\n2. Capture the parameter(s) of any function.\n3. Assign the return value as an expression.\n\nIn this case, since get_magic_number is a function returning 42 without any parameters, it should be converted to 'get_magic_number: f() = 42'.\n\nI need to make sure that if there are no parameters, they're not included in the output. Also, ensure that the syntax is correct, using colons and spaces appropriately.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the mini version would be:\n\nget_magic_number: f() = 42\n\nThat should accurately represent the original Python code's functionality.\n</think>\n\nget_magic_number: f() = 42",
