Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the provided Python code:\n\ndef get_magic_number():\n    return 42\n\nFrom this, I understand that the function `get_magic_number` returns 42 without any parameters since there are no parentheses after the function definition.\n\nThe task is to transform this into a mini-wizard style. The rules specify:\n1. Function name becomes `:`\n2. Parameters in `f(...)` form, with none if missing.\n3. Return value after `=`.\n4. Output only the mini-wizard-like structure without extra explanations or comments.\n\nSo, translating each part:\n\n- The function name is `get_magic_number`, so in mini-wizard it becomes `get_magic_number:`.\n- There are no parameters, so instead of `f()`, we use an empty f.\n- The return value is 42, which becomes the right side after `=`.\n\nPutting it all together, the mini-wizard should be:\n\nget_magic_number:  = 42\n\nI need to ensure that only the structure is output without any additional text. So the final answer should be this concise form.\n</think>\n\nget_magic_number:  = 42",
