Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the provided Python code: it's a function called get_magic_number which doesn't take any parameters and returns 42. \n\nThe task is to transform this into a MINI WORSHIP model based on specific rules. From what I understand, I need to convert each part of the Python function into a corresponding structure in MINI WORSHIP.\n\nLet me break down the steps:\n\n1. **Python\u4ee3\u7801\u5206\u6790:**\n   - The function starts with `def get_magic_number():` which defines the function name and its parameters.\n   - Inside the function, there's a return statement returning 42.\n   \n2. **Transformation Rules:**\n   - Function name becomes colon followed by the name in MINI WORSHIP.\n   - Parameters are converted to f(...) where empty implies default parameter as an empty tuple or something similar? Wait, looking at the example given, when there's no parameters, it uses `f()` with no arguments. So for Python's return statement without parameters, we might represent it differently.\n\n3. **Generating MINI WORSHIP:**\n   - The function name becomes `get_magic_number`.\n   - Since there are no parameters, perhaps the parameter part is not present, so maybe just omit it.\n   - The return value is 42, which in MINI WORSHIP would be represented as `= 42`.\n\nPutting this together, the transformation should result in a structure where each Python line is converted into corresponding parts of MINI WORSHIP. However, looking at the example provided by the user, they transformed it into `get_magic_number: f() = 42`. So I need to follow that format.\n\nSo, applying all these steps, the final transformation would be a string representing the function in MINI WORSHIP terms.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef get_magic_number():\n    return 42\n```\n\n```python\nget_magic_number: f() = 42\n```",

My task is to convert this into a Python function.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each part of the mini-language. The function name is 'get_magic_number', which becomes the function name in Python. Since there's no parameter mentioned after f(), it means the function doesn't take any arguments.\n\nNext, looking at the right side of the equation, 42 is the return value. So, the function should return 42 when called.\n\nNow, putting this together into a Python function structure. In Python, functions are defined using def followed by the function name and parameters in parentheses. Since there's no parameter here, it'll just be def get_magic_number():.\n\nThen, for the return statement, I need to assign the value 42 to the function. So, after defining the function, I add a return statement that returns 42.\n\nI should also make sure the code is correct and follows Python syntax. No markdown blocks or extra comments are allowed; just the generated Python code.\n\nSo, putting it all together: define the function with the name get_magic_number, without any parameters, and have a return statement that outputs 42.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef get_magic_number():\n    return 42\n```",

The user provided a Python code and wants it converted into a mini-wizard-like markup language called \"minibble.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the given Python function:\n\ndef get_magic_number():\n    return 42\n\nThe task is to convert this into a structure that resembles a mini-wizard's thinking process. So, let me break down each step.\n\nStep 1: Identify the function name and parameters. The function is named 'get_magic_number' with no parameters.\n\nStep 2: Determine the return value. It returns 42, which is an integer.\n\nNow, applying the conversion rules:\n\n- Replace Python function names with colon-preceded names.\n- Parameters are wrapped in f(...) format; if none, it's f().\n- Return values use = after them instead of return.\n\nSo, translating this into a mini-wizard structure would involve defining the function name and parameters first. Since there are no parameters, we'll have 'f()'. Then, set the magic number using = 42.\n\nPutting it all together, the structure should reflect that the function is named get_magic_number with no arguments, returns 42 as an integer.\n</think>\n\n```python\ndef get_magic_number():\n    return 42\n```\n\n```python\ndef get_magic_number():\n    return 42\n```",
