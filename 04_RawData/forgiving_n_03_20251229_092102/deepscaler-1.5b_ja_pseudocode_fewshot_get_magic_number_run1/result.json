Let me look at the original code first.\n\nThe original function is called get_magic_number() and it returns 42. So, in the example provided, there's a function definition and then a return statement.\n\nIn pseudocode, we usually don't use the same syntax as Python. Instead of def, we might use something like function_name. And instead of return, maybe just write \"return\" or describe what it returns.\n\nSo for get_magic_number(), in pseudocode, I should define the function name and then specify that it returns 42. The explanation part isn't needed here since the task is only to convert into a style similar to Python but using pseudocode.\n\nI think the correct approach is to write \"function get_magic_number() returns 42\" as the first line, and perhaps just note its return value in parentheses or something like that.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to structure it similarly to Python. In Python, functions are defined with def, but in pseudocode, perhaps we can use \"def\" but without the syntax. Alternatively, maybe use a colon instead of 'def' for function declaration.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps just write the function name and then state its return value.\n\nSo putting it all together, the pseudocode would be:\n\nfunction get_magic_number():\n    returns 42\n\nThat seems appropriate.
