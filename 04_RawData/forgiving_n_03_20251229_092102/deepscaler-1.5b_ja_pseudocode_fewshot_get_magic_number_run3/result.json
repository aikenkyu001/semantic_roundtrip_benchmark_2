The original code is a function called get_magic_number which simply returns 42.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the function definition. In pseudocode, functions are written in steps, so I should start by defining the function name and parameters. Since there's only one parameter, maybe just 'def' followed by the function name and then an empty space for parameters. Wait, actually, since it's a single parameter with no default, perhaps I can write it as `def get_magic_number():`.\n\nNext, inside the function, there's just a return statement that returns 42. So in pseudocode, each step should be clear. Maybe start by writing \"Function get_magic_number is defined\" followed by its description.\n\nThen, within the parentheses, perhaps list what needs to be done. Since it just returns 42, maybe include a comment indicating that the function returns this value regardless of any input parameters.\n\nWait, looking back at the example provided, the pseudocode starts with \"\u95a2\u6570 get_sum(a, b):\" which is similar to how functions are defined in programming languages like Python. So perhaps I should follow that structure.\n\nSo for get_magic_number, it's a function without any parameters since it doesn't take any inputs. Therefore, the parameter line would have an empty space or just nothing after the opening parenthesis.\n\nPutting it all together, the pseudocode might look like:\n\n\u95a2\u6570 get_magic_number():\n    \u5b9a\u7fa9\u51fd\u6570\u540d\n    \u51fa\u73b0\u63cf\u8ff0\u8bf4\u660e\u8fd4\u56de\u503c\u4e3a42\n\nAlternatively, since the function doesn't use any parameters, maybe just focus on the steps inside. So perhaps start with 'Function get_magic_number is defined as' followed by its description.\n\nSo the pseudocode could be:\n\n\u95a2\u6570 get_magic_number()\n    \u5b9a\u4e49\u51fd\u6570\n    \u51fa\u73b0\u63cf\u8ff0\u8bf4\u660e\u8be5\u51fd\u6570\u8fd4\u56de42\n\nBut considering the example given in the problem, which used a function with parameters and steps inside. Maybe for simplicity, I can structure it as follows:\n\n\u95a2\u6570 get_magic_number():\n    \u5b9a\u4e49\u51fd\u6570\u540d\n    \u51fa\u73fe Description: return 42\n\nAlternatively, since the input doesn't matter, perhaps just write 'def' followed by nothing in parameters, then a comment that returns 42.\n\nSo maybe:\n\n\u95a2\u6570 get_magic_number()\n    \u5b9a\u4e49\u51fd\u6570 name 42\n\nBut perhaps it's better to structure it as per the example. The example had a function with parameters and steps, so perhaps for this case, since there are no parameters, I can write it as:\n\ndef get_magic_number():\n    return 42\n\nWait, but that's the actual Python code.
