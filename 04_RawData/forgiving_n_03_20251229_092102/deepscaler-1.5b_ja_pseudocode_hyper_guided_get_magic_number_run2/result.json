The steps are as follows:\n\n1. Analyze the Python code:\n   - The function starts with `def get_magic_number():`.\n   - It has a return statement returning 42.\n\n2. Apply the conversion rules:\n   - Function name: get_magic_number, represented in pseudo-code as `get_magic_number()`.\n   - Return value: 42 is converted to `return 42`.\n\n3. Generate the pseudo-code format without any explanations or comments.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the pseudo-code would be:\n\nfunction get_magic_number(): returns integer 42\n</think>\n\ndef get_magic_number():\n    return 42",
