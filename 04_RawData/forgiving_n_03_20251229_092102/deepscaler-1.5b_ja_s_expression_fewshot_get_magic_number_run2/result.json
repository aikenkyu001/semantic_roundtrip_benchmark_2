Let me look at the example first.\n\nIn the example, the Python code is:\n\ndef get_sum(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\nAnd the corresponding S expression is:\n\n(function (name get_sum) (parameters (param a) (param b)) (returns (value (+ a b))))\n\nSo the structure seems to follow that of an S expression for functions and parameters.\n\nNow, looking at the task's example code:\n\ndef get_magic_number():\n    return 42\n\nI need to write its S expression. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the function is named get_magic_number(), which becomes (function (name get_magic_number)). But wait, in the example, the name was 'get_sum', so I think the order should be (function (name get_magic_number))? Or maybe it's ordered as (parameters (param name) ...). Wait no, let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps for functions without parameters, like a top-level function, it would just be (function (name)). But in this case, there is an empty parameter list because the function takes zero arguments. So how does that translate?\n\nIn S expressions, for a function with parameters, you have (parameters name param value). If there are no parameters, maybe it's just (function name), but perhaps more accurately, since there are no parameters after the name, the structure would be (function (name)).\n\nBut wait, looking back at the example, in that case, the function has two parameters a and b. So their order is important because they come after the function name.\n\nSo for get_magic_number(), which returns 42, it's a function with no parameters. Therefore, its S expression would be:\n\n(function (name get_magic_number))\n\nBecause there are no parameters after the name. Wait, but in the example, when there were parameters, the order was (parameters param1 param2). So perhaps for functions without parameters, we just have (function name), and if they had parameters, it's ordered as (function (name) (parameters ...)).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the example again.\n\nThe first example:\n\ndef get_sum(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\nS expression:\n(function (name get_sum) (parameters (param a) (param b)) (returns (value (+ a b))))\n\nSo it's structured as function (name ...) parameters (params ...) returns (...).\n\nIn the task code, there are no parameters. So perhaps for that case, since there are no parameter names or values, we can represent it as:\n\n(function (name get_magic_number))\n\nBut wait, maybe in S expressions, functions with no parameters after the name would just be (function (name)). But let me think about how to structure it correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that for a function without any parameters, like def get_magic_number():..., the S expression starts with (function (name)), and since there are no parameters or values, maybe nothing else is added. Or perhaps if there are parameters, they come after in order.\n\nWait, let's think about how functions are structured in S expressions. The general form is:\n\n(function (params) (returns ...))\n\nWhere params can be an array of parameter lists, each with name and value.\n\nIn the first example, it's a function with two parameters a and b, so the structure would be:\n\n(function (parameters (param a)(param b))(returns (value (+a b))))\n\nSo in that case, for our task code, since there are no parameters or values beyond the function name, perhaps we can represent it as just:\n\n(function (name get_magic_number))\n\nBecause there's nothing else after the return.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in S expressions, if a function has parameters but they're not named, like for a built-in function, it might be written differently. But I think for this problem, since there are no parameters or values beyond the name, we can just write (function (name get_magic_number)).\n\nBut wait, perhaps the return value is 42, so in the S expression's returns clause, we have:\n\n(returns (value (+ a b)))\n\nIn our case, it's simply returning 42. So maybe the parameters part ends there because it's a top-level function without any parameters or values beyond the name.\n\nSo putting it all together, the S expression would be:\n\n(function (name get_magic_number))\n\nBecause there are no parameter names or values after that.\n</think>\n\n(function (name get_magic_number))",
