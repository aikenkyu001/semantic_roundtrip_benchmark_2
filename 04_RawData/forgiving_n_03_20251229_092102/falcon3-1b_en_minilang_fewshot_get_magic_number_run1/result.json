Minilang is an implementation of the lambda calculus with minimal operational semantics, so translating to this language typically means representing operations as functions and expressions using lambdas or similar constructs.\n\nLet's consider each example:\n\n### Python Code:\n```python\ndef add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n```\n\n**Python Code to Minilang:**\n```ml\nadd: f(a, b) = a + b\n```\n\nThis minilang specification states that the function `add` takes two parameters `a` and `b`, and returns their sum. The lambda calculus equivalent directly translates this as a function definition with the body `f(a, b) = a + b`.\n\n### Python Code:\n```python\ndef get_magic_number():\n    return 42\n```\n\n**Python Code to Minilang:**\n```ml\nget_magic_number: f() = 42\n```\n\nHere, the lambda calculus equivalent for this Python function is represented as a single expression: `f()` directly returns the value `42`. The syntax uses a function name prefixed with an empty argument list, which represents no parameters.\n\n**Final Minilang Specifications:**\n- For `add(a, b)`:\n  ```ml\n  add: f(a, b) = a + b\n  ```\n\n- For `get_magic_number()`:\n  ```ml\n  get_magic_number: f() = 42\n  ```",
