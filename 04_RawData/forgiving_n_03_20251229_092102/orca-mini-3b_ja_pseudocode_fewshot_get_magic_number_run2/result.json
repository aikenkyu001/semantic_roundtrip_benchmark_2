It appears to be a basic Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Here is an explanation of how it works:\n\n1. The function definition is enclosed in parentheses and contains the name of the function (get_sum) and two parameters (a and b).\n2. When the function is called, the values of a and b are passed as arguments to the function.\n3. The result of the function call is returned to the caller.\n4. The function definition does not end with a semicolon or any other statement that is executed.\n\nTo convert this code to the desired format, you would need to define a function that takes two parameters and returns their sum. Here is an example:\n\n```python\ndef add_numbers(a, b):\n return a + b\n```\n\nThis function definition follows the expected format for a \"Python code to convert to a given style.\"",
