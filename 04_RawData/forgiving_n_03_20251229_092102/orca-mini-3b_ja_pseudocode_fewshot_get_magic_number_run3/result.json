However, I can help you understand the concept of a mockery function in Python and provide you with a mockery code example. Here's an example of a mockery function that takes two arguments and returns their sum:\n\n```python\ndef mockery(a, b):\n return a + b\n```\n\nIn this code, `mockery` is the name of the function, `a` and `b` are the input arguments, and `return` is the expected output. This function is a simple implementation of a mockery function that adds two inputs together.",
