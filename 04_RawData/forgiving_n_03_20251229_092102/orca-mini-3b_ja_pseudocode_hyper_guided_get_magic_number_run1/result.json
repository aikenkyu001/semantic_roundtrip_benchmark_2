As an AI assistant, I can suggest some general steps that may be involved in designing a system using EKVTS, but it is not a specific task that can be completed with a single solution. \n\n1. Choose the appropriate EKVTS device and configure it according to your needs.\n2. Develop a user interface for the EKVTS that allows users to interact with the device.\n3. Develop a keyboard mapping system that assigns virtual keys to physical keys or letters on the keyboard.\n4. Develop software applications that allow users to input text, numbers, and images into the EKVTS.\n5. Test and debug the system to ensure that it functions accurately and reliably.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or requirements, I can provide more information.",
