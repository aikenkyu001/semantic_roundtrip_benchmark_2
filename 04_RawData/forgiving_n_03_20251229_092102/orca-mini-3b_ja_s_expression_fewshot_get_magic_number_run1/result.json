            "step1_raw_spec": "In Python, the S-style function definition is used to define a function that takes two or more parameters and returns a single value. Here's an example of how to convert the Python code into the S-style format:\n\n```\ndef get_sum(a, b):\n return a + b\n\n```\nIn this example, we define a function called `get_sum` that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns their sum. \n\nThe `parameters` block is not needed in the S-style format because Python uses the `name` keyword to indicate the name of the function. In this case, the `name` used is `get_sum`. \n\nThe `return` statement is used to return the value of `a + b`, which is the sum of `a` and `b`.\n\nWhen we use this function, we don't need to provide any parameters because Python uses the `name` and `value` syntax to indicate the function's behavior. In this case, the `value` block is empty and the `return` statement is executed when the function is called. \n\nSo, the `get_magic_number()` function in Python returns the value of 42, which is the result of adding the two parameters (0 and 0).",
