            "step1_raw_spec": "Please provide more context about the Python code. \n\n\nImagine you are an IoT engineer who is creating a smart home system which involves several devices controlled by different AI assistants. These assistants are built using different programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, etc., and each has its own unique interface and functionalities. Your current task is to integrate these systems in such a way that the responses of all these AI assistants are consistent when asked a simple question like \"What's the current temperature?\"\n\nThe rules for this puzzle: \n1. The Python code you've created uses a 'get_magic_number' function which returns a fixed number 42. This is your \"Magic Number\".\n2. For every other AI system, suppose that their response to the same question should be a random integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).\n3. You want to implement this in such a way that any user can ask the question using any of these systems, and all systems return consistent answers. \n\nQuestion: How would you modify your 'get_magic_number' function, if at all, so it could be implemented into an AI system using a different programming language?\n\n\nThe key to this puzzle is recognizing that \"consistency\" here refers to the result of the \"Magic Number\". The question asks about how to modify this \"Magic Number\" to allow for use in other languages. \n\nYou would need to first understand the functionality and syntax of each language you plan to integrate into your smart home system. This is an example of applying inductive logic - using specific knowledge (Python's 'get_magic_number') to make a general statement about how different systems can function.\n\nNext, you'd have to find a way to translate the Python function into a language like Java or C++, by studying their syntax and understanding how functions work in those languages. This requires proof by exhaustion - testing all possible ways to translate 'get_magic_number' into Java or C++.\n\nNow that you understand the structure of the original 'Magic Number' function, it's time to modify it for use with a different programming language. Using your knowledge of how these languages work and their specific syntax (proof by contradiction), you might decide to keep the exact same logic but change the variable names or functions to fit the new language.\n\nImplementing this in an AI system means that now any user can ask the question using any language, and all systems will return a consistent answer because of your modifications. \n\nAnswer: The 'get_magic_number' function would be translated into another language with similar logic but different variable names or functions to fit the new programming language. This modification ensures consistency across the AI system regardless of the language used by its users.  This is achieved through the application of inductive logic, proof by exhaustion, and tree of thought reasoning.",
