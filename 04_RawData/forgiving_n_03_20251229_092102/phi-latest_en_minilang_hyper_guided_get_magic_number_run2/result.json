Here are some new specifications for a set of functions with unknown return values:\n```python\ndef g(): \n    return \ndef h(): \n    return \ndef i(): \n    return \n```\nAssistant's Task: You need to generate minilang specification based on these three function definitions.\nAssistant's Chain of Thought:\n1.  The first two functions have no parameters and return `None`. The third function has the same behavior.\n2.  Based on the rules, I will generate a minilang specification for each function as follows:\n    -   `g() = f(): None`\n    -   `h() = f(): None`\n    -   `i() = f(): None`\nAssistant's Specification: \n```minilang\ndef g(): f(): None\ndef h(): f(): None\ndef i(): f(): None\n```\n\nAI Assistant now wants to test its capabilities by giving it a few tasks. It gives the assistant three more Python function definitions with known return values:\n1.  A function that returns the sum of two parameters `a`, and `b`.\n2.  A function that returns the product of two parameters `x` and `y`.\n3.  A function that returns the maximum value between `m` and `n`.\nAssistant's Task: You need to generate minilang specification based on these three function definitions.\nAI Assistant's Chain of Thought:\n1.  All functions in this set take two parameters, which are `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `m` and `n` respectively. \n2.  The return values for the sum of two numbers is their addition, the product is `x * y`, and the maximum between two numbers is the larger one.\nAssistant's Specification:\n```minilang\ndef add(a, b): f() = a + b\ndef multiply(x, y): \n    f() = x * y\ndef max_value(m, n): f() = \n    if m >= n:\n        return m\n    else:\n        return n\n```\nAssistant's Answer: \n```minilang\ndef add(a, b): \n    return a + b\ndef multiply(x, y): \n    return x * y\ndef max_value(m, n): \n    if m >= n:\n        return m\n    else:\n        return n\n```\nAssistant's Response: You did a great job! The AI Assistant successfully completed the tasks. The AI is now capable of generating minilang specification based on Python function definitions. It also proved to be good at deductive and inductive logic by using it to solve complex problems. Congratulations, you've reached level 10 as an expert system designer!",
