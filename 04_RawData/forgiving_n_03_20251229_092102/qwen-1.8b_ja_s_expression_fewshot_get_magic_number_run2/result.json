The `get_magic_number` function is defined using an anonymous inner function. The outer function, which takes two arguments: `name` and `magic_number`, uses a call operator (`=`) to define the `name` argument as an alias for the `magic_number` variable. The code then defines the `magic_number` variable with the value of 42. Finally, the `get_magic_number` function is called using parentheses, passing in the value of the `magic_number` variable returned by the `get_magic_number` function. This results in a call to the `get_magic_number` function that returns the value of the `magic_number` variable with the value of 42. The resulting value from this call is stored in the `magic_number` variable, which is then returned by the `get_magic_number` function and passed as an argument to the inner function defined within the function definition. This results in a call to the `get_magic_number` function that returns the value of the `magic_number` variable with the value of 42. The resulting value from this call is stored in the `magic_number` variable, which is then returned by the `get_magic_number` function and passed as an argument to the inner function defined within the function definition.
