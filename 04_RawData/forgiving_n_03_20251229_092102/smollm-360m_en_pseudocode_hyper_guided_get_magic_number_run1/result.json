The function name is changed from `get_magic_number` to `get_magic_number`, and the code in the function body is removed, leaving only the return statement. The pseudocode includes the function signature (e.g., \"return 42\"), the function's purpose (e.g., \"returns a magic number\"), and any relevant comments or explanations.\n\nNote that this is just one possible way to translate a Python function into a pseudocode format, and there are many other ways to do it. The key is to focus on the essential elements of the function, such as its purpose, parameters, and return value, and use the rules for translation to ensure consistency across different implementations.",
