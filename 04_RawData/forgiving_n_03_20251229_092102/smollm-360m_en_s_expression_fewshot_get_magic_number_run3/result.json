The `ast.literal_eval()` function takes a string as input and returns a string representation of the object. In this case, it returns a string representing the result of calling the `get_sum` function with the arguments 10 and 20.\n\nThe S-expression specification in Python is defined using the `ast.S` class. The `S` class represents an S-expression, which can be used to define a set of values that are evaluated when the expression is executed. In this case, we have defined a set of values for the `a` and `b` parameters, which are passed to the `get_sum` function as arguments.\n\nThe `ast.S` class also defines a `get_result` method, which returns the result of evaluating the S-expression. In this case, the `get_result` method is called when the S-expression is evaluated. The `get_result` method takes an optional argument `name`, which specifies the name of the S-expression to be returned as a value. If not specified, the S-expression is interpreted as a function that returns a string representation of the result.\n\nHere's how you can translate the Python code into a S-expression specification in Python:\n\n```python\nimport ast\n\ndef get_sum(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\ns = get_sum(10, 20)\nprint(s)  # Output: 30\n```\n\nThe `ast.S` class is used to define the S-expression specification in Python.
