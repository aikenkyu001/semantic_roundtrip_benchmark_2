It defines a function named `get_sum` that takes two parameters `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.\n\nNow let's convert this Python function into S syntax. We'll need a function for each input provided by Python, so we'll need three functions: one for getting the first input (`first_input`), another for getting the second input (`second_input`), and finally our function that uses these inputs to add them together (`addition`).\n\nS syntax is quite similar to Python. We can define functions using keyword 'def' followed by the name of the function, parameters enclosed in parentheses, and then an indented block of code.\n\nHere's how we could do this:\n\n```s\nfirst_input = get_1st_input()\nsecond_input = get_2nd_input()\n\ndef addition(a: first_input, b: second_input):\n  return a + b\n\naddition() # This will output the sum of the two inputs\n```\n\nIn S syntax, `get_1st_input` and `get_2nd_input` would be functions with no arguments, just like in Python. In `addition`, we specify that both 'a' and 'b' are types specified by `first_input` and `second_input` respectively.\n\nPlease note: the actual implementation of these S functions (`get_1st_input()`, `get_2nd_input()`) is left as an exercise for you to implement based on your application requirements.",
