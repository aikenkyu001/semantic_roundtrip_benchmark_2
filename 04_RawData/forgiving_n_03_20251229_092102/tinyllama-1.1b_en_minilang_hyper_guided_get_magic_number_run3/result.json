Analyze the Python code:\n     - Identify the function name from the `def` statement, which in this case is \"get_magic_number\".\n     - Identify the parameters from inside the `()` parentheses, which are not needed as the function does not have any parameters.\n     - Identify the return value from the `return` statement, which is the integer value \"42\" returned by the function.\n\n2. Convert the Python code to MiniLang:\n    - Replace the Python function name with its MiniLang equivalent \"f()\", which stands for a function without parameters and a return value.\n    - In the parentheses, use `f()` instead of `get_magic_number` as this is the MiniLang way to refer to the function as a string literal.\n    - The result should be: `(f()) = 42`.\n\n3. Apply the rules:\n     - If no parameters are passed, use an empty parentheses list `()` to specify that the function has no parameters.\n     - Make sure that only the raw MiniLang specification without any comments, comments or other text is outputted from this step onwards.",
