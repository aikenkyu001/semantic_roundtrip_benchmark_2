This specification means that the function will return an integer value of 42 (or whatever value you choose) using a keyword called \"return\". The \"RETURN\" keyword tells the Python interpreter to return the specified value immediately.\n\nStrict Output Format:\nThe output format for pseudocode is very strict, and it must always be written exactly as stated above.
