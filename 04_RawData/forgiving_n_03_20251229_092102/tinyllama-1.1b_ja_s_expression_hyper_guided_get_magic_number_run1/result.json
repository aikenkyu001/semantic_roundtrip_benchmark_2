            "step1_raw_spec": "To convert a Python function to S-expression, follow these steps:\n\n1. Analyze the function: Look for functions that start with \"def\" and have three parts:\n   - A function name (usually lowercase)\n   - Arity (number of arguments, usually 0 or 1), followed by a list of parameter names separated by spaces\n   - A body containing the actual code to execute\n   - The return type (if any) and any parameters with values (optional)\n\n2. Convert the function name: The function name is already in S-expression format, so it's just a matter of converting each part to its equivalent parts. In this case, it starts with \"def\", followed by one or more lowercase letters that represent the Python function name without any spaces. 3. Analyze the parameter names: Each parameter is also in S-expression format, so it can be converted by simply putting each parameter name on a separate line and separating them with spaces. For example, if we have a Python function called \"add_numbers\" that takes two integers as its parameters (i.e., the sum of two numbers), the resulting S-expression for this function would look like:\n```s\n(def add_numbers (num1 num2) (sum (+ num1 num2)))\n``` 4. Convert the body of the function: The actual code that should be executed is the last part of the S-expression, which starts with \"(\" and ends with \")\". This means that we need to convert each group of parentheses to a series of separate lines, separated by spaces, like this: `(put (expr) value)`\n```s\n(def add_numbers (num1 num2)\n     sum (+ num1 num2))\n``` 5. Convert the return type and any values passed as parameters: The last part of the S-expression that contains the return type is also converted to its equivalent S-expression format. This means that it starts with an \"=\" sign followed by a string representing the Python return type (e.g., \"int\"), followed by two or more lines containing the actual values, separated by spaces. For example:\n```s\n(def add_numbers (num1 num2)\n     sum (+ num1 num2))\n\n(put num1 value)\n(put num2 value)\n(put result value)``` 6. Generate the S-expression: Finally, generate the S-expression by combining the converted parts into a single string, using one or more lines per each part.",
