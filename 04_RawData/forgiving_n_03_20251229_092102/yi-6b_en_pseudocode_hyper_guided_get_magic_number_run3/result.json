Your task is to find the most frequent word in the text and return it as an output. Follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Python Code:** First, think step-by-step about the provided code.\n    -   The input `text` should be split into a list of words using the space character (`' '`) as the delimiter.\n    -   Create an empty dictionary to store word frequencies.\n    -   Iterate through each word in the list of words:\n        -   Check if the word is already a key in the dictionary. If it is, increment its value by 1.\n        -   If the word is not a key in the dictionary, add it as a key and set its value to 1.\n    -   Iterate through each (word, frequency) pair in the dictionary:\n        -   Find the maximum frequency among all pairs.\n2.  **Apply Translation Rules:** Convert the Python code to pseudocode based on these rules.\n    -   The input variable name becomes `<input_name>`.\n    -   The function name becomes `FUNCTION <function_name>(<input_name>):`.\n    -   The dictionary of word frequencies is named `word_frequencies`.\n    -   The maximum frequency becomes `MAX_FREQUENCY`.\n\n3.  **Generate Specification:** Based on your analysis, generate ONLY the pseudocode.\n\n4.  **Strict Output Format:**\n    -   You MUST output ONLY the raw pseudocode text.\n    -   Do NOT include any explanation, comments, or any text other than the specification itself.\n\n### TASK ###\n\nPython Code:\n```python\ndef find_most_frequent_word(text):\n    words = text.split(' ')\n    word_frequencies = {}\n    for word in words:\n        if word in word_frequencies:\n            word_frequencies[word] += 1\n        else:\n            word_frequencies[word] = 1\n    MAX_FREQUENCY = 0\n    most_frequent_word = ''\n    for (word, frequency) in word_frequencies.items():\n        if frequency > MAX_FREQUENCY:\n            MAX_FREQUENCY = frequency\n            most_frequent_word = word\n    return most_frequent_word\n```\n\nChain of Thought:\n1.  The input variable is `text`.\n2.  Split the text into a list of words using space as a delimiter and store it in `words`.\n3.  Create an empty dictionary called `word_frequencies` to store word frequencies.\n4.  Iterate through each word in `words`:\n    -   Check if the word is already a key in `word_frequencies`. If it is, increment its value by 1.\n    -   If the word is not a key in `word_frequencies`, add it as a key and set its value to 1.\n5.  Set `MAX_FREQUENCY` to 0 and create an empty string called `most_frequent_word`.\n6.  Iterate through each (word, frequency) pair in `word_frequencies`:\n    -   Find the maximum frequency among all pairs.\n7.  Compare the current frequency with `MAX_FREQUENCY` and update if necessary.\n8.  Store the most frequent word in `most_frequent_word`.\n9.  Return `most_frequent_word` as the output of the function.\n\nPseudocode Specification:\n```pseudocode\nFUNCTION find_most_frequent_word(text): \n    words = text.split(' ')\n    word_frequencies = {}\n    FOR each word in words:\n        IF word is a key in word_frequencies THEN\n            INCREMENT the value of word by 1\n        ELSE\n            SET the value of word to 1\n    MAX_FREQUENCY = 0\n    most_frequent_word = ''\n    FOR each (word, frequency) pair in word_frequencies:\n        IF frequency is greater than MAX_FREQUENCY THEN\n            SET MAX_FREQUENCY to frequency\n            SET most_frequent_word to word\n    RETURN most_frequent_word\n```",
