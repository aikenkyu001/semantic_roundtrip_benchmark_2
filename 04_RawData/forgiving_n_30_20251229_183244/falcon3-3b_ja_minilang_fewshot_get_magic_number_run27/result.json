Below are the translations:\n\n### Example 1:\n**Python Code:**\n```python\ndef add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n```\n\n**Magical Language Representation:**\n`add: f(a, b) = a + b`\n\n### Example 2:\n**Python Code:**\n```python\ndef get_magic_number():\n    return 42\n```\n\n**Magical Language Representation:**\nSince the operation itself doesn't change, we keep it as is because Magical Language would interpret this directly as a function returning `42`.\n\n---\n\nThese translations assume that Magical Language understands and interprets Python functions similarly to how it processes symbolic or literal expressions. The key is translating the logic of the operations into its own language-specific format, which in our case is just rephrasing the operation in terms of a function `f(a, b)`.",
