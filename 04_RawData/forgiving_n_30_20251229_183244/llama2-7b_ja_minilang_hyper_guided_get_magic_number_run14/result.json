Function name: `get_magic_number`\n2. Parameters: none\n3. Return value: `42` (a integer)\n\nUsing these observations, we can apply the conversion rules to generate the mini language specification. Here's the result:\n\nMini language specification: `get_magic_number: f() = 42`\n\nNote that we have applied the following rules:\n\n* The Python function name is now a colon-separated name in the mini language, as per rule 1.\n* The Python parameters are now inside the `f()` function call, as per rule 2.\n* The return value of the Python function is now the content after the equal sign in the mini language specification, as per rule 3.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!",
