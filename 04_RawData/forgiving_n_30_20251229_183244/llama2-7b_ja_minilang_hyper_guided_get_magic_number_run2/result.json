Based on the provided rules, I will transform the Python code into a minimal language specification.\n\n1. Analysis:\n\t* Function name: `get_magic_number`\n\t* Parameters: None\n\t* Return value: `42`\n2. Transformation rules:\n\t* Python function name becomes a colon-separated name before the parameter list. So, `get_magic_number()` becomes `:f()`\n\t* Python parameters are enclosed in `f()` for lack of any other parameter. So, `get_magic_number(x)` becomes `f(): x = 42`\n\t* Return value is moved after the colon and becomes a simple assignment. So, `return 42` becomes `= 42`\n3. Output:\n```\n:f() = 42\n```\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!",
