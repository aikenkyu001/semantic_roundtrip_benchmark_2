Here are the steps we need to follow:\n\n1. Analyze the Python code:\n\t* Identify the function name `get_magic_number`.\n\t* Determine that there are no parameters.\n\t* Identify the return value as an integer `42`.\n2. Apply the transformation rules:\n\t* The function name becomes a colon-separated name before the parameter list. So, `get_magic_number` becomes `get_magic_number: f()`.\n\t* The parameter list becomes a single parameter `f()` without any parameters.\n\t* The return value becomes the value after the `=`. In this case, it's `42`.\n3. Generate the specification:\n\t* Based on the analysis and transformation rules, we can generate the mini language specification: `get_magic_number: f() = 42`.\n4. Output the specification:\n\t* The output should be a string consisting only of the mini language specification. So in this case, it would be `get_magic_number: f() = 42`.\n\nGreat! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.",
