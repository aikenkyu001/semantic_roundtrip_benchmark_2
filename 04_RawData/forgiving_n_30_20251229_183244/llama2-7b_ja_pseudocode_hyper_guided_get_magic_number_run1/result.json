Let's get started with the task.\n\nBased on the provided Python code, we can analyze and transform it into a mock code specification as follows:\n\n1. **Python code analysis**: The given Python code defines a function `get_magic_number()` that returns an integer value of 42.\n2. **Transformation rules application**: Based on the provided transformation rules, we can transform the Python code into a mock code specification as follows:\n```scss\n\u95a2\u6570 get_magic_number():\n\u623b\u308a\u5024 42\n```\n3. **Specification generation**: We have generated a mock code specification that consists of only the necessary information, without including any unnecessary details such as comments or documentation. The specification is in the format of a Python function definition with a single return statement.\n4. **Strict output format**: We are required to output the mock code specification in a strict format, which means that we must include only the essential information and exclude any extraneous text. The output should be in the form of a Python function definition with a single return statement.\n\nTherefore, the final mock code specification for the given Python code is:\n```scss\n\u95a2\u6570 get_magic_number():\n\u623b\u308a\u5024 42\n```",
