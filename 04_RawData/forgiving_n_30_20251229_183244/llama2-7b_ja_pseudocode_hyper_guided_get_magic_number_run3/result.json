Python Code Analysis:\nThe given Python code is `def get_magic_number(): return 42`.\n2. Pseudocoding Rule Application:\nBased on the rules provided, we can apply the following transformations to the Python code:\n\t* `def get_magic_number()` becomes `\u95a2\u6570 get_magic_number:`\n\t* `return 42` becomes `\u623b\u308a\u5024 42`\n3. Pseudocoding Specification Generation:\nUsing the analyzed Python code and the applied transformations, we can generate the pseudocoding specification as follows:\n```scss\n\u95a2\u6570 get_magic_number():\n\u623b\u308a\u5024 42\n```\n4. Output Formatting:\nWe must output the pseudocoding specification in a strict format. Here is the output:\n```scss\n\u95a2\u6570 get_magic_number:\n\u623b\u308a\u5024 42\n```\nThat's it!
