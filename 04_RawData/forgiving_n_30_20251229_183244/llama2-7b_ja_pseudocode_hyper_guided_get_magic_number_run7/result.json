Function names in pseudo-code are prefixed with `\u95a2\u6570 `.\n2. Return values in pseudo-code are prefixed with the return type of the function (in this case, `\u623b\u308a\u5024`).\n\nTherefore, the pseudo-code for the given Python code is:\n```python\n\u95a2\u6570 get_magic_number(): \u623b\u308a\u5024 42\n```\nPlease let me know if you have any further instructions or questions!",
