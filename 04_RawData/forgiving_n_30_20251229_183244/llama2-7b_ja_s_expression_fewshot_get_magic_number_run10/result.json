In S-expressions, we represent functions using the `(function ...)` form. The name of the function is enclosed in parentheses, followed by the parameters and the return value.\n* `def get_magic_number(): return 42`: This is another function definition in Python. The only difference between this one and the previous one is that it has no parameters. Therefore, we can omit the `parameters ()'` part of the S-expression.\n\nI hope this helps!
