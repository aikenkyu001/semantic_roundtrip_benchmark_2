The input code defines a simple standalone function named `get_magic_number` in Python, which simply returns the integer value 42 when called. An S-expression (or symbolic expression) representation would define this as follows:\n\n```lisp\n(define (get-magic-number) 42)\n```\nHowever, to strictly follow your format request for an explicit return statement in a function definition style and translate it into the more generic `S-expression` notation used typically within Lisp or similar functional programming languages:\n\n```lisp\n(define (get-magic-number) 42)\n```\nThis representation uses `(define ...)` to define an anonymous function wherein, instead of using parentheses and parameters as in Python's `def`, we use the keyword `define`. Note that this is a very minimalist approach just for illustrative purposes.",
