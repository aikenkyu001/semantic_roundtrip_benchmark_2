Your response should strictly adhere to these expanded criteria:\n\n1. **Detailed Analysis of Code Functionality and Structure** (Including but not limited to identifying function name(s), parameters with types if any, return values along with their expected data type conversions when necessary):\n   - Deduce the purpose or intent behind each parameter based on Python's standard libraries or common conventions.\n   \n2. **Advanced S-Expression Specification**: Apply a more complex translation rule set that incorporates your analysis of functionality and structure in detailing types, conversions where applicable within an enhanced format (e.g., `(function ...)`). This should include handling for the following cases if identified:\n   - Multiple parameters with different data types.\n   - Conditional logic within a function body leading to multiple return paths or possible exceptions. \n   \n3. **Exception Handling Representation** in S-expression format, indicating any anticipated errors and their resolutions (e.g., `catch ...`).\n\n4. **Strict Output Format: Advanced Specification with Comment Annotations for Key Steps/Decisions Made During Conversion Process on Separate Lines Following Each Part of the Expression** - Ensuring annotations clearly explain your thought process and adhere strictly to S-expression format without deviation or additional commentary outside these lines.\n\n### TASK ###\nPython Code:\n```python\ndef calculate_area(radius):\n    if not isinstance(radius, (int, float)):\n        raise ValueError(\"Radius must be a number\")\n    return 3.14 * radius ** 2\n    \n```\n\nChain of Thought:\n1. The function name `calculate_area` implies it calculates the area from some geometric measurement which is commonly understood to use radii, suggesting that this might involve circle calculations or comparisons with another shape's dimensions (e.g., radius). Given Python\u2019s standard libraries and conventions, I deduce its purpose as calculating a circular object's area using given `radius` parameter data type expectation of an integer or float for precise mathematical computations without error due to non-numeric input types being handled by the initial conditional check in the code.\n   \n2. The function has one mandatory parameter: radius, which is expected to be a numeric value and thus can either be an `int` or `float`. Based on this information, I will generate the S-expression `(function ...)` with corresponding annotations explaining my thought process at each step of conversion into advanced format including conditional logic representation.\n\nS-expression Specification:",
