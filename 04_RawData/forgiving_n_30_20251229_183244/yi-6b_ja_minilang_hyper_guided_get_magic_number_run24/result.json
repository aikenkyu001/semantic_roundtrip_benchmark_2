Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n### Instruction ###\n\n1. **Analyze Python Code:** Start by analyzing the provided Python code, which in this case is:\n    ```python\n    def get_magic_number():\n        return 42\n    ```\n   - Identify the function name from the `def` statement as the mini-specification name. In our case, it's \"get_magic_number\".\n   - Determine the parameters (if any) by looking into the parentheses following the `def` statement. Since there are no params, this part is empty in our mini-spec.\n   - Identify the return value from the `return` statement as the result of the mini-spec. For \"get_magic_number\", it's just a simple integer `42`.\n\n2. **Apply Conversion Rules:** Use these rules to convert the Python code into a mini-spec:\n   - The function name becomes the identifier in the mini-spec format: `get_magic_number`.\n   - If there are no parameters, leave out the parentheses part of the spec. If there are parameters, include them between brackets `[]`: `f()` for our case since it has none.\n   - Place the return value after an equal sign and a space: `42` becomes `= 42` in our mini-spec.\n\n3. **Create Mini-Specification:** Using the analysis, construct the mini-specification as follows:\n   ```plaintext\n   get_magic_number: f() = 42\n   ```\n\n### Task Solution ###\n\nThe Python function `get_magic_number` is now fully converted into a mini-specification form:\n\n```plaintext\nget_magic_number: f() = 42\n```\nThis mini-specification meets the criteria of being formatted as instructed, with no additional comments or descriptions included.",
