Let's look at the example first to understand how it's done.\n\nIn Example 1, the Python code defines a function called add that takes two arguments, a and b, and returns their sum. The minilang specification describes this function as \"add: f(a, b) = a + b\". So, each line in the minilang corresponds to a part of the Python function.\n\nNow, looking at the task's Python code:\n\ndef get_magic_number():\n    return 42\n\nThis is a simple function that returns 42 when called. It doesn't take any parameters and just returns a constant value. \n\nIn minilang terms, I should describe this as a function named 'get_magic_number' which returns 42. Since it's a standalone function without parameters or side effects beyond returning the value, there won't be any variables or expressions to define.\n\nSo, translating this into minilang, it would just list the name and its return value. There are no parameters since the function doesn't take any inputs, so I don't need to specify f(a,b) or anything else.\n</think>\n\nget_magic_number: returns(42)",
