Let me first look at the example provided to understand how it's done.\n\nIn the example, the Python code is:\n\ndef add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\nAnd the minilang specification is:\n\nadd: f(a, b) = a + b\n\nSo, the key steps are:\n1. Identify the function name and its parameters.\n2. Determine what the function returns.\n3. Express this as a mathematical expression or formula within a function definition.\n\nNow, looking at the task's Python code:\n\ndef get_magic_number():\n    return 42\n\nThis is a simple function called get_magic_number that takes no arguments (since it doesn't have any parameters) and returns the value 42.\n\nIn minilang terms, I should represent this as a function definition. Since there are no parameters, it would be something like \"get_magic_number()\". The return statement just outputs the number 42. So in the minilang specification, it should probably have the function name and then specify what it returns.\n\nPutting it together, the minilang specification for this code would likely look like:\n\nget_magic_number: f() = 42\n\nWait, but does the structure need to be more detailed? Let me think. The original example used a return statement as part of the formula. Maybe in this case, since there are no parameters, it's just returning a constant value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minilang specification is written as:\n\nget_magic_number() = 42\n\nBut considering the structure, maybe it should be expressed with the function name and an expression that equals 42.\n\nSo I think the correct translation would be:\n\nget_magic_number: f() = 42\n</think>\n\nget_magic_number: f() = 42",
