Let me think about each step carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at the Python function provided: def get_magic_number(): return 42. The name is 'get_magic_number'. There are no parameters inside the parentheses, so it's just f(). The return value is 42, which is an integer.\n\nNow, applying the translation rules. The function name becomes the part before the colon, so that's 'get_magic_number:'. Then, the parameters go inside f(...). Since there are none, I use f() as per rule 2. Finally, the return value comes after the equals sign in minilang.\n\nPutting it all together, the specification should be \"get_magic_number : f() = 42\". Wait, but looking back at the example given in the task, it was 'get_magic_number: f() = 42'. So I think that's correct. \n\nI don't see any need for further processing or changes beyond converting each part as per the rules.
