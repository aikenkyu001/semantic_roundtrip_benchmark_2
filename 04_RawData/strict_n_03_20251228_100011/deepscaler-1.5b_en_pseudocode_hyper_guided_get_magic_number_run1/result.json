The function is named `get_magic_number()` and it returns 42. So, my first task is to identify these two elements: the function name and its return value.\n\nThe next step is to translate this into pseudocode based on specific rules. From the instructions, I know that the function name in pseudocode should be written as `FUNCTION <name>():` and the return statement becomes `RETURN <value>`.\n\nPutting it all together, the steps are:\n1. Identify the function name: 'get_magic_number'.\n2. Determine the return value: 42.\n3. Construct the pseudocode with these elements in the correct format.\n\nI should make sure that there are no other parts of the code provided to translate beyond this function. Since it's a simple function, the pseudocode will only include these two components.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the final pseudocode specification would be:\n```\nFUNCTION get_magic_number():\n    RETURN 42\n```\n\nI need to ensure that I follow the rules strictly: no additional text and just the necessary parts. Also, since there's nothing else in the original code, this should cover everything.\n</think>\n\nThe function is named `get_magic_number` and returns 42.\n\nPseudocode Specification:\n```\nFUNCTION get_magic_number():\n    RETURN 42\n```",

            "step2_generated_code_raw": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to convert this pseudocode into Python code based on the given instructions. Let me start by understanding what's provided.\n\nThe pseudocode is a function called get_magic_number which simply returns 42. So first, I should identify the function name and the return value from the pseudocode.\n\nLooking at the pseudocode: it starts with a function definition, then immediately returns 42. So in Python, this would translate directly without any changes except for proper syntax.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Identify the function name. In the pseudocode, the function is named get_magic_number, so that's straightforward.\n2. Determine the return value. The pseudocode uses RETURN 42, which in Python translates to returning an integer 42.\n3. Apply these into a Python function.\n\nIn Python, functions are defined with def. So I'll write:\n\ndef get_magic_number():\n    return 42\n\nThat should correctly implement the pseudocode's functionality. There's no need for any additional logic or steps because the pseudocode is very simple and doesn't require any conditionals or loops.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert a given pseudocode into Python code based on specific instructions.\n\n### Approach\nThe task involves analyzing the provided pseudocode to extract the function name and return value. The pseudocode defines a function `get_magic_number()` that returns 42. The approach is straightforward as it only requires translating this function definition directly into Python syntax.\n\n1. **Function Name Extraction**: Identify the name of the function in the pseudocode, which is \"get_magic_number\".\n2. **Return Value Extraction**: Observe the return value specified in the pseudocode, which is 42.\n3. **Translation to Python**: Convert the extracted function name and return value into a Python function definition.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef get_magic_number():\n    return 42\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The function `get_magic_number` is defined using the `def` keyword, specifying its name.\n- Inside the function, we use the `return` statement to output the value 42, which matches the pseudocode's requirement.\n\nThis approach ensures that the provided pseudocode is accurately translated into a correct Python function.",

The function is named get_magic_number, which translates directly in pseudocode as \"function get_magic_number()\". The return statement returns the integer 42, so that becomes a RETURN statement.\n\nNow, applying the translation rules:\n\n1. Identify the function name: It's already given as get_magic_number(), so no change needed beyond naming it as FUNCTION and formatting it correctly.\n2. The return value is 42, which in pseudocode is written using RETURN instead of returning.\n\nPutting it all together, the pseudocode should start with the function definition, followed by the function name, then the parameters (which there are none), and finally the RETURN statement with the value.\n\nSo the final pseudocode would be:\n\nFUNCTION get_magic_number():\n    RETURN 42\n\nI think that's accurate. Let me double-check: The original code is a simple function without any parameters, so no arguments are needed in pseudocode beyond what's necessary for clarity.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to translate a given Python function into a specific format of pseudocode. The goal is to accurately represent the functionality of the provided Python code using standard pseudocode notation.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Function Name and Return Value**: From the provided Python code `def get_magic_number(): return 42`, we extract the function name as \"get_magic_number\" and its return value as 42.\n2. **Translate Function Name and Return Statement**: Convert the function name into a pseudocode format, ensuring it follows standard naming conventions. Similarly, replace the return statement with a RETURN statement to match pseudocode syntax.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```pseudocode\nFUNCTION get_magic_number():\n    RETURN 42\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function Name**: The function name in pseudocode is written as `function get_magic_number()`, which mirrors the original Python function but uses standard pseudocode conventions.\n2. **Return Statement**: The return value of the function, which is an integer 42, is replaced with a RETURN statement to indicate that this value should be returned from the function.\n\nThis approach ensures that the code is concise and adheres to pseudocode conventions while preserving the functionality of the original Python code.",
