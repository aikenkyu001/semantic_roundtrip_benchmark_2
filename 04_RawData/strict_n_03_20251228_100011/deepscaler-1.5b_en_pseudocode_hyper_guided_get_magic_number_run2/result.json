Let's start by analyzing the provided code.\n\nThe Python function is defined as def get_magic_number(): and it returns 42. So first, I should identify the function name and its return value.\n\nLooking at the function definition line: def get_magic_number(). The name here is 'get_magic_number' because it's what the function is called with. Wait, no\u2014actually, in Python, the function name is just the part before the colon without spaces or anything. So the function name is 'get_magic_number'.\n\nThen, looking at the return statement: return 42. That means when this function is executed, it will output the integer 42.\n\nNow, according to the instructions, I need to translate this into pseudocode based on two rules:\n1. The Python function name becomes 'FUNCTION <name>()'.\n2. The return value becomes 'RETURN <value>'.\n\nSo for the function definition line: def get_magic_number() becomes FUNCTION get_magic_number(). But wait, in Pseudocode, we typically don't include spaces or extra punctuation, so maybe it's written as FUNCTION GET_Magic_NUMBER(): or just without spaces? Hmm, perhaps better to keep the original structure but remove any unnecessary parts.\n\nWait, looking at the example given: The user provided a Python code with def get_magic_number() and return 42. They translated it into FUNCTION get_magic_number(): RETURN 42. So in their case, they removed the space after 'def' and before the parentheses, perhaps because Pseudocode prefers concise syntax.\n\nSo for our task, I should follow that structure: function name followed by () with no spaces around, then return statement as RETURN <value>.\n\nPutting it all together:\n- Function name is get_magic_number.\n- The return value is 42.\n\nThus, the pseudocode specification would be:\n\nFUNCTION get_magic_number(): RETURN 42\n\nI think that's correct. Let me double-check. The original function returns 42, and in Pseudocode, we replace def with FUNCTION and return with RETURN. So yes, this should work.\n</think>\n\nFunction get_magic_number(): RETURN 42",
