The original code is a function called get_magic_number which returns 42. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the Python function. It's defined as def get_magic_number(): and then it returns 42. So in pseudocode, functions have a name, parameters, and return statement.\n\nI should start by writing the function name, which is get_magic_number. Then, since there are no parameters mentioned, I can assume it takes none. The return value is simply 42.\n\nIn pseudocode, each step of the function should be clear and concise. So maybe like:\n\nfunction get_magic_number():\n    returns 42\n\nThat seems straightforward. I don't need to include any details about variables or loops since there are no such elements here.
