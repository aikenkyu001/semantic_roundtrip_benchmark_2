Wait, looking again, the actual code is:\n\ndef get_magic_number():\n    return 42\n\nSo this function takes no arguments and returns 42.\n\nNow, according to the instructions, I need to create a pseudo-code version of this function. The steps are:\n\n1. Identify the function name from the def statement. Here, it's 'get_magic_number'.\n2. Determine the return value. It's 42.\n3. Use the format 'functionName(): returnReturnValue' as per the rules.\n\nSo putting it all together, the pseudo-code should be something like:\n\nfunction get_magic_number():\n    return 42\n\nI need to make sure that this is a valid Python-like structure but without the syntax errors.
