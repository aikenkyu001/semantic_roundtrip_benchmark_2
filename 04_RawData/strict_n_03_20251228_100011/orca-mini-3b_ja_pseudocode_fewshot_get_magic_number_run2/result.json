Here's the Python code that uses a similar approach to your requested code:\n\n```\ndef get_sum(a, b):\n return a + b\n\ndef get_magic_number():\n return 42\n```\n\nIn this case, we have a function called `get_sum` that simply adds two numbers together. Then we have another function called `get_magic_number` that returns the result of the same operation in Python.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need any further assistance.",
