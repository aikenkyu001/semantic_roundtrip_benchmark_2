Return the value of the `return` statement inside the function.\n3. Analyze the code and check if it produces any output, or if it only prints the text \"```python get_magic_number(): \u623b\u308a\u5024 42```\" in a browser tab.\n4. Create a Python object that you can use to simulate an input value that will be passed to the `get_magic_number()` function. For example, create an object `MagicNumber` with a single attribute `value` set to the output of the function:\n```python\nMagicNumber = 42\n```\n5. Use the `MagicNumber` object to call the `get_magic_number()` function and check if the output is equal to the value of the `MagicNumber` object. If it is not, you may need to modify the code to produce an error or an exception instead of a warning.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.",
