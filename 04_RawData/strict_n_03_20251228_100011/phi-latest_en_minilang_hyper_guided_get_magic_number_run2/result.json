The AI uses a custom version of minilang language to communicate, which uses Python function calls as commands. Your task is to decrypt the AI's command and take actions on it based on your knowledge about the AI's communication style.\n\nThe encrypted message reads: \"call_function(lambda x: \nif x == 'get_magic_number': \n    return 42\nelif x == 'set_password': \n    #TODO: write a function to set password here\nelse: \n    raise Exception('Unknown Command')\n)`\n\nThe AI's communication style is such that it uses the following rules:\n-  It uses minilang language, where Python functions are translated into commands.\n-  Functions are named based on their purpose and parameters.\n-  Parameters are represented as variables inside the function call.\n-  Parameters with no value (e.g., `x = None`) are replaced by `()`. \n\nQuestion: What should be your next step to understand the AI's command and take action accordingly?\n\n\nAnalyze the Python code within minilang language.\n\nIdentify the function used in the AI's message, which is `get_magic_number` and its parameters. The parameter is `x`.\n\nTranslate this into a minilang specification. The name of the function becomes the command's name before the colon `:`, the variable `x` is replaced by `f(...)` for simplicity and added to the command, and the value of 42 (returned by Python function) is assigned to it.\n\nThe decrypted command translates to: `call_function('get_magic_number', f(...)) \n\nSince you've identified that this was a security-related command, you can guess that the AI wants you to set up a password.\n\nAs we know from common sense reasoning, in programming languages, `lambda x:` is used for anonymous functions. So 'set_password' command is just an alias of setting up a password which might be stored as an arbitrary string. \n\nWe can infer that the parameters are used to store the new password. The AI's code suggests it uses function-like rules, so the parameters could be used to hold the current and new passwords.\n\nUsing this logic, write a function in Python to set the new password using these parameters: `current_password` and `new_password`. \n\nFinally, run the decrypted command as an action. This will return 'True' if the password is successfully updated or 'False' if it fails.\n\nAnswer: The next step should be to create a function that sets up passwords using `set_password(current_password, new_password)` and then running this command based on the decrypted AI's communication.",
