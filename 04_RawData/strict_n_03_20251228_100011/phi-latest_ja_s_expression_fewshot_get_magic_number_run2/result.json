Let's assume that these two instances are encoded as two binary strings:\n1. The code for arbitrary function is \"1001\" in binary.\n2. The code for specific task is \"0111\".\n\nThe assistant mentioned that the function for arbitrary case and task can be transformed into another binary code by following certain rules:\n- Each digit represents a character, where 0 is 'a', 1 is 'b', 2 is 'c' and 3 is 'd'.\n- The first three digits represent the input arguments.\n- The last digit of the output indicates whether this instance was handled as an arbitrary function or a specific task. \n\nThe assistant mentioned that for both binary codes, the order of characters in the output represents a string in which each character corresponds to a particular letter (in the same order) and 0s are represented by 'a' and 1s by 'b'. \n\nQuestion: What is the output for the arbitrary function? And what is it for the specific task?\n\n\nThe binary code for \"1001\" represents an input string of characters. By using a bitwise XOR operation on this binary number with 10101010, we can determine which letters in our output should be 'a' and 'b'. \nSo, (1001)^(10101010) = 01110110. This is the representation of the function's arguments as characters: \"ad\". Hence, the output will contain these characters plus the last digit indicating whether it was handled as an arbitrary or specific case.\n\nThe binary code for \"0111\" represents a string of 'a's and 'b's. By XORing this with 01100101, we get: \n(0111)^(01100101) = 11100110. This gives us the characters \"abc\". The last digit indicates that it is an arbitrary function, not a specific one.\n\nAnswer: For the arbitrary function, the output would be 'ad'. For the specific task, the output would be 'abc'",
