This module provides various functions for generating random numbers.\n\nThe `get_magic_number()` pseudocode function generates a random number between 1 and 9 (inclusive).\n\n```plaintext\nfunction get_magic_number():\n    import random\n\n    set output to a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive\n\nEND\n```\n\nThis pseudocode illustrates how to implement such functionality using Python's `random` module. It shows that the function is designed to return a randomly generated integer within a specific range (in this case, between 1 and 9).",
