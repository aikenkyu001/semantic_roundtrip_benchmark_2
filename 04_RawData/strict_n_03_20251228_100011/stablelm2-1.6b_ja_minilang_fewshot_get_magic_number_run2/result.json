The provided Python code defines an addition function named \"add\". In Minion language (or Hex) that function translates to \"`get_`\" followed by the name of the function (\"add\") then \"`=`\", and finally the two parameters separated with a space.\n\nHere is the Minion language version:\n\n```Minion\n[get]\nname = add\n\n    [a, b]\nf(a, b)  = a + b\n```\n\nThis Minion code translates to Python as follows: \n\n```Python\ndef get_2add(): \n    return sum([1, 2]) # Example usage of the function with two numbers\n```\n\nRemember that Minion is just for demonstration purposes and should not be used in actual production environments. It may have hard-to-read syntax due to the use of prefixes (\"get\") for function names.",
