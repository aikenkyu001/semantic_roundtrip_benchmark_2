First, take note of the function name from the `def` statement. It should be written as follows: `\"get_magic_number\"`\n\n2. Next, identify the parameters using the parentheses and parentheses within them. In this case, we have `()` which stands for a list of parameters separated by commas. So, our function has no parameters.\n\n3. Next, identify the return value from the `return` statement. Since we don't have any returns in this function, the `return` statement doesn't need to be included.\n\n4. Finally, convert the Python code to MiniLang specifications by applying translation rules. In our case, we simply have the following:\n\n```minilang\nget_magic_number: f() = 42\n```\n\n5. The above specification now represents a complete MiniLang program that includes only the raw MiniLang code and no comments or other text.",
