Analyze and understand the Python code: I will first review the provided Python code and identify the sections that need to be converted into a minilanguage format.\n\n2. Determine the necessary rules and guidelines: Based on my analysis, I will determine the necessary rules and guidelines for converting the code into a minilanguage format. These may include identifying variable names, modifying function names, or ensuring proper spacing and indentation.\n\n3. Implement conversion: I will then implement the required changes to the Python code, including variable name conversion, function renaming, and other necessary modifications.\n\n4. Generate minilanguage output: Finally, I will generate a minilanguage output based on the converted code, which should be clean, concise, and properly formatted. This output will follow the guidelines outlined in the conversion rules and will accurately reflect the original code.\n\nBy following these steps, you can convert your Python code into a standardized format that follows best practices for minilanguages.",
