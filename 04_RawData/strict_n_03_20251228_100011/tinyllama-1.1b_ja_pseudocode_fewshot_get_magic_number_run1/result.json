Inside the loop, we print out the value of the current integer with the \"print()\" statement.\n- The main function is defined as a single-line statement that prompts the user for input and runs the interpreter with the given command. The line to the left of \"try:\" reads the value of an integer from the user and assigns it to a variable named \"a\". If the user enters a negative number or an integer outside the range [0, 1], we catch any exceptions raised by the function and print an error message.\n- Finally, the line to the left of \"except ValueError as e:\" catches the exception raised by the function called \"get_sum\" and prints the value of the variable named \"return_value\".",
