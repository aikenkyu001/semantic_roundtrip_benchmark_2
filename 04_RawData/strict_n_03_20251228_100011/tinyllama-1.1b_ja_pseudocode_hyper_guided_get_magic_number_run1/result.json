            "step1_raw_spec": "To successfully complete the task of converting a Python function into a proof-of-concept (PoC) using Python code verification tools, follow these steps:\n\n1. Analyze the provided Python code: The first step is to analyze the provided Python function to identify all its essential elements, including its name, parameters, return value, and any comments or documentation. It's important to note that some Python functions may include additional information, such as docstrings or variable names.\n\n2. Use verification tools: There are several Python code verification tools available online, including Checkmarx, SonarQube, and PyLint. Choose the one that best fits your development environment and workflow. Each tool has its own unique features, so it's essential to familiarize yourself with each of them before using them in this task.\n\n3. Create a proof-of-concept (PoC): Once you have analyzed and verified the Python code, create a PoC that satisfies the provided requirements. This PoC should be written in a similar way to the original function, but it should include additional features or functionality not included in the original code.\n\n4. Implement new features: Once your PoC meets the requirements, continue to add features and functionality as necessary to create a complete and robust Python-based proof-of-concept (PoC). Make sure to follow best practices for modularity and encapsulation when implementing new code, and also consider any potential impacts on existing code.\n\n5. Test and validate: Once your PoC is completed, test it thoroughly and make any necessary changes or improvements as required. Use automated testing tools such as pytest to ensure that your Python functions behave correctly in a variety of scenarios. Finally, before releasing the PoC, ensure that all necessary permissions have been granted by the project team for public distribution.\n\nIn summary, this task requires careful analysis and verification of Python code, followed by the creation of a proof-of-concept (PoC) using Python code verification tools. Once the PoC has met the requirements, it can be tested and validated to ensure that it functions correctly in various scenarios.",
