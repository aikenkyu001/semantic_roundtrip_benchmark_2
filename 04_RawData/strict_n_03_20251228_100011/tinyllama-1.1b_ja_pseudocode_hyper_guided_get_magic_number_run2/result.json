            "step1_raw_spec": "To perform the task of Python code conversion into Python-based APIs, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Analyze the provided Python code: Start by carefully analyzing the Python code provided in step 1. It is essential to understand what specific functions and methods are being called, their inputs and outputs. You should also check if there's any logic involved that might require a Python API or library.\n\n2. Define the API requirements: Once you have a clear understanding of the functionality required, you can define the API requirements. This involves defining how to make requests to the API, as well as the data returned in response. You may also need to specify any security measures such as authentication and authorization.\n\n3. Transform the Python code into Python-based APIs: Based on your requirements, you'll create an API that converts the Python code into a set of Python-based classes and methods. This will allow you to interact with the API from a Python environment without having to write any code.\n\n4. Test the API: Once you have an implementation, it's time to test your API. This involves running unit tests (e.g., testing individual methods) to ensure that all necessary functions and methods are working correctly. You can also run integration tests to make sure the entire API works as expected across different environments.\n\n5. Implement the Python-based classes: Once you have tested the API, it's time to implement the Python-based classes. This involves writing code for each of the functions and methods specified in the requirements document. You may also need to write documentation or comments to explain the purpose of each function or method.\n\n6. Implement authentication and authorization: To ensure secure access to your API, you will need to implement authentication and authorization mechanisms. This involves defining how users can authenticate themselves and obtain a valid token, as well as any other security measures required for your specific application.\n\n7. Test the API with real data: Before making the API publicly available, it's a good idea to test the API with real data. You can do this by generating requests or performing data manipulations using Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas. This will help ensure that the API provides accurate results for actual use cases.\n\n8. Launch the API: Once you have tested the API, it's time to launch it. This involves creating a server or hosting the API on a web server and setting up appropriate endpoints. You may also need to set up some monitoring tools to track performance and errors.",
