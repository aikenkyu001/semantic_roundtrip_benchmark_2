Identify the necessary imports and functions:\n    The first step is to identify all necessary dependencies, import them, and define any functions that will be used in the code. This can include any libraries or packages that your Python code imports or functions that you use within your Dart code. Here's an example Python code with necessary imports and functions defined:\n\n    ```python\n    from random import randint\n    \n    def get_random_number():\n        return randint(1, 10)\n    \n    def sum_of_numbers(numbers):\n        total = 0\n        for num in numbers:\n            total += num\n        return total\n    \n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        print(sum_of_numbers([randint(1, 10) for _ in range(3)]))\n    ```\n\n2. Apply DartPad's syntax highlighting:\n    Once you have defined your necessary imports and functions, you can use the DartPad code editor to apply DartPad's syntax highlighting to your Python code. This will help you identify any errors or inconsistencies in your code, as well as provide a visual representation of how your code would be written in Dart. Here's an example Python code with proper indentation and syntax highlighting:\n\n    ```python\n    def get_random_number():\n        return randint(1, 10)\n    \n    def sum_of_numbers(numbers):\n        total = 0\n        for num in numbers:\n            total += num\n        return total\n    \n    main()\n    ```\n\n3. Convert to Dart by editing your Python code:\n    Once you have identified any errors or inconsistencies in your Python code, it's time to convert them into equivalent Dart code using DartPad's syntax highlighting. Here's an example of what this would look like:\n\n    ```python\n    import random\n    \n    def get_random_number():\n        return random.randint(1, 10)\n    \n    def sum_of_numbers(numbers):\n        total = 0\n        for num in numbers:\n            total += num\n        return total\n    \n    main()\n    ```\n\n4. Review your Dart code to ensure it is formatted correctly:\n    After converting your Python code into Dart syntax, it's a good idea to review it to ensure that the formatting is consistent with DartPad's indentation and syntax highlighting. Here's an example of what this would look like:\n\n    ```dart\n    import random;\n    \n    // Function definitions start here\n    \n    def getRandomNumber():\n        return Random().nextInt(1, 10);\n    \n    // Function definitions end here\n    \n    // Main function starts here\n    \n    main() {\n        List numbers = new List.from([\n            random.nextInt(1, 10),\n            random.nextInt(1, 10)\n        ]);\n        double total = 0;\n        for (int num in numbers) {\n            total += num;\n        }\n        print(\"Total is $total\");\n    }\n    \n    // Main function ends here\n    \n    // Name of main function starts here\n    \n    void main() {}\n    ```\n\n5. Commit and push your changes to the DartPad project:\n    Once you've reviewed your Dart code and ensured that it is formatted correctly, it's time to commit and push these changes to the DartPad project. This can be done using the DartPad GitHub repository's `Push` button or by adding a reference to the DartPad project to your Git repo and pushing from there. Here's an example of what this would look like:\n\n    ```git\n    $ git add -A\n    $ git commit -m \"Fixes bug in Python code.\"\n    $ git push origin main\n    ```\n\nWith these steps, you should now have a fully-formatted and commented Dart code that can be used in your future DartPad projects.",
