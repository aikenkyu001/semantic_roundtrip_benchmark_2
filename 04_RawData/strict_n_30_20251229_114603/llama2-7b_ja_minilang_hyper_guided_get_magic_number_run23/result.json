Here are the steps we need to follow:\n\n1. **Python code analysis**: Let's start by analyzing the provided Python code. We can identify the function name `get_magic_number()`, the absence of parameters, and the return value `42`.\n2. **Translation rules application**: Based on the given rules, we can transform the Python code into a minimal language specification. For example, the function name becomes `get_magic_number: f() = 42`.\n3. **Specification generation**: We need to generate a minimal language specification that consists only of the transformed function name and the return value. In this case, the specification would be `get_magic_number: f() = 42`.\n4. **Strict output format**: The generated specification must be in a strict format, where only the transformed function name and return value are included. No comments, descriptions, or other text outside of the specification is allowed.\n\nLet's apply these rules to the provided Python code and generate the minimal language specification.",
