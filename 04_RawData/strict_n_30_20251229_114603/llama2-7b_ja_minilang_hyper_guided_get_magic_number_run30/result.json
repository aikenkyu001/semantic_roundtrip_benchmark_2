Here are the results:\n\t* Function name: `get_magic_number: f()`\n\t* Parameters: none\n\t* Return value: `42`\n3. **Specification generation**: We will generate the mini language specification based on the converted code. The output will be a single line of text that represents the mini language specification.\n\nHere is the generated specification: `get_magic_number: f() = 42`\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.",
