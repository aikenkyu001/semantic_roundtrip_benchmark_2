# File and Directory Descriptions

This document provides an overview of the directories and key files in the `semantic_roundtrip_benchmark` project.

## Root Directory

-   `README.md`: A high-level overview of the project, its purpose, methodology, and how to run the experiments.
-   `FILE_DESCRIPTIONS.md`: (This file) A detailed description of all files and directories.
-   `requirements.txt`: A list of Python dependencies required to run the analysis and testing scripts.
-   `LICENSE`: The license file for the project.
-   `academic_paper_en.md`: The manuscript of the academic paper summarizing the findings of this research, in English.
-   `academic_paper_jn.md`: The manuscript of the academic paper summarizing the findings of this research, in Japanese.

## `01_TestDefinitions/`

- Contains the ground truth code, pseudocode specifications, and test runner scripts for each benchmark task.
    -   Subdirectories are named after the test case (e.g., `fizzbuzz`, `process_user_list`, `separate_vowels_and_consonants`).
    -   `initial_code.py`: The reference Python implementation of the task.
    -   `ground_truth_<lang>_<spec_lang>.txt`: The ground truth specification for the task in a given language and specification format.
    -   `test_runner.py`: A Python script that executes the generated code and validates its functional correctness against predefined test cases.

## `02_Prompts/`

- Contains the prompt templates used to instruct the LLMs for both Code-to-Spec and Spec-to-Code transformations.
    -   Structured as `/<test_case>/<language>/<spec_language>/<prompt_style>.prompt`.
    -   Examples: `fizzbuzz/en/pseudocode/code_to_spec_hyper_guided.prompt`.

## `03_Scripts/`

- Contains the core executable scripts for running the benchmark experiments.
    -   `run_adaptive_benchmark.sh`: Runs benchmarks for specific test cases and models, typically using `pseudocode` and `hyper_guided` prompt styles. Used for focused runs.
    -   `run_benchmark.sh`: A comprehensive benchmark runner primarily for the `get_magic_number` task. It iterates through all combinations of languages, specification types (`pseudocode`, `s_expression`, `minilang`), and prompt styles (`fewshot`, `hyper_guided`).
    -   `run_fizzbuzz_benchmark.sh`: A comprehensive benchmark runner specifically for the `fizzbuzz` task. Similar to `run_benchmark.sh`, it iterates through all combinations of languages, specification types, and prompt styles.
    -   `run_cycle_test_syntactic.py`: The core Python script that executes a single semantic round-trip test cycle (Code-to-Spec and Spec-to-Code). This script is called by the shell runner scripts.
    -   `run_all_experiments.sh`: A top-level script to centrally run and manage the key comparative benchmark experiments described in the paper.
    -   `run_llama3_8b_tests.sh`: Script to run specific tests for the Llama 3 8B model.

## `04_RawData/`

- Contains the raw JSON logs (`result.json`) from the benchmark runs. Each subdirectory corresponds to a specific test condition and run.

## `05_Reports/`

- Contains analysis scripts, generated reports, and summaries of the experimental findings.
    -   `analyze_with_ci.py`: A Python script that analyzes the raw data from `04_RawData/`, calculates success rates, and computes 95% confidence intervals. This script generates `analysis_with_ci.csv` and `analysis_aggregated.csv`.
    -   `analysis_with_ci.csv`: The detailed CSV output generated by `analyze_with_ci.py`, containing individual run results with confidence intervals.
    -   `analysis_aggregated.csv`: The aggregated CSV output generated by `analyze_with_ci.py`, summarizing results across models and test conditions.
    -   `experiment_log.md`: A log summarizing the experimental procedure and key findings throughout the research.
    -   `degradation_data.csv`: CSV file containing data related to degradation analysis.
    -   `generate_degradation_data.py`: Script to generate degradation analysis data.
    -   `experiment_documentation.md`: A comprehensive document detailing the experimental scripts, data structures, aggregation processes, and a complete summary of all experiment results. Includes Mermaid diagrams for visualizing workflows.

## `06_References/`

- Contains downloaded PDF versions of relevant academic papers and a `README.md` listing them.
